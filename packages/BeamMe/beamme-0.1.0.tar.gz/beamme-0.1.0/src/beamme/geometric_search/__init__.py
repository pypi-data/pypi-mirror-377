r"""This module defines geometric search functionality.

This module contains functionality to find points close to each other in
a point cloud. Currently, three different implementations for the actual
search algorithm are available (depending on your installation/setup):

- `brute_force_cython`: A brute force algorithm implemented in Cython,
  scales with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, but for a small number of points
  ($n<200$) this is the fastest algorithm since compared to the others
  it does not have any setup costs.

- `kd_tree_scipy`: Uses a
  [bounding volume hierarchy (BVH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy)
  implementation provided by
  [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.KDTree.html).
  This scales with $\mathcal{O}(n\ \log{n})$.

- `boundary_volume_hierarchy_arborx` : Uses a
  [bounding volume hierarchy (BVH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy)
  implementation provided by [ArborX](https://github.com/arborx/ArborX).
  This also scales with $\mathcal{O}(n\ \log{n})$
  but due to a more optimised implementation is a few times faster
  than the scipy implementation.

The `find_close_points` function automatically chooses the fastest
(available) implementation for the given point array.

Consult the `README.md` regarding install and testing options for
different implementations.

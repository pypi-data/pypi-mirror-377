    Args
    ----
    mesh: Mesh
        Mesh that the helical segment will be added to.
    beam_class: Beam
        Class of beam that will be used for this line.
    material: Material
        Material for this segment.
    axis_vector: _np.array, list
        Vector for the orientation of the helical center axis.
    axis_point: _np.array, list
        Point lying on the helical center axis. Does not need to align with
        bottom plane of helix.
    start_point: _np.array, list
        Start point of the helix. Defines the radius.
    helix_angle: float
        Angle of the helix (synonyms in literature: twist angle or pitch
        angle).
    height_helix: float
        Height of helix.
    turns: float
        Number of turns.
    warning_straight_line: bool
        Warn if radius of helix is zero or helix angle is 90 degrees and
        simple line is returned.

    **kwargs (for all of them look into create_beam_mesh_function)
    ----
    n_el: int
        Number of equally spaced beam elements along the line. Defaults to 1.
        Mutually exclusive with l_el.
    l_el: float
        Desired length of beam elements. Mutually exclusive with n_el.
        Be aware, that this length might not be achieved, if the elements are
        warped after they are created.

    Return
    ----
    return_set: GeometryName
        Set with the 'start' and 'end' node of the line. Also a 'line' set
        with all nodes of the line.

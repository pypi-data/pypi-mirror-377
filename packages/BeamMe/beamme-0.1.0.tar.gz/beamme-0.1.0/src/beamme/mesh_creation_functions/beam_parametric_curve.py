    Args
    ----
    mesh: Mesh
        Mesh that the curve will be added to.
    beam_class: Beam
        Class of beam that will be used for this line.
    material: Material
        Material for this line.
    function: function
        3D-parametric curve that represents the beam axis. If only a 2D
        point is returned, the triad creation is simplified. If
        mathematical functions are used, they have to come from the wrapper
        autograd.numpy.
    interval: [start end]
        Start and end values for the parameter of the curve.
    output_length: bool
        If this is true, the function returns a tuple containing the created
        sets and the total arc length along the integrated function.
    function_derivative: function -> R3
        Explicitly provide the jacobian of the centerline position.
    function_rotation: function -> Rotation
        If this argument is given, the triads are computed with this
        function, on the same interval as the position function. Must
        return a Rotation object.
        If no function_rotation is given, the rotation of the first node
        is calculated automatically and all subsequent nodal rotations
        are calculated based on a smallest rotation mapping onto the curve
        tangent vector.

    **kwargs (for all of them look into create_beam_mesh_function)
    ----
    n_el: int
        Number of equally spaced beam elements along the line. Defaults to 1.
        Mutually exclusive with l_el.
    l_el: float
        Desired length of beam elements. Mutually exclusive with n_el.
        Be aware, that this length might not be achieved, if the elements are
        warped after they are created.

    Return
    ----
    return_set: GeometryName
        Set with the 'start' and 'end' node of the curve. Also a 'line' set
        with all nodes of the curve.

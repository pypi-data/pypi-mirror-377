# EqUMP
IRT Equating for Unidimensional Mixed Format Test with Python

## Motivation
Item Respone Theory (IRT) test equating is a critical process for maintaining score comparability across different test forms. However, current implementations often rely on limited software or complex scripting environments. We introduce EqUMP, a Python package designed to streamline and democratize IRT equating for unidimensional mixed format test. Built upon the robust ecosystem of scientific computing in Python (Numpy, Scipy), it provides a flexible framework for various IRT equating methods (e.g., scale transformation, true score equating). The package is openly licensed, pip-installable, and includes comprehensive documentation and test suites, enabling researchers and practitioners to readily reproduce analysis pipelines. By leveraging Python‚Äôs accessibility and extensibility, EqUMP facilitates rigorous and reproducible test equating for a wider educational data analysists and psychometricians.

## Core Principles
- **Academically faithful code and documentation**  
  EqUMP is designed for researchers and practitioners familiar with standard test equating literature. We follow textbook-style notation and structure‚Äîeven at the cost of computational speed‚Äîto ensure clarity and pedagogical value.

- **Practical focus**  
  While many equating methods exist in the literature, some are infeasible in operational testing. EqUMP prioritizes features that reflect real-world usage and operational constraints. Users can request or contribute less common methods.

- **Symmetric linking constant support**  
  Symmetry property of equating function is a critical but often neglected aspect of Haebara or Stocking-Lord linking method. EqUMP handles this through carefully implemented two-sided(symmtric) or one-sided loss function.

## Installation
```bash
pip install eqump
```

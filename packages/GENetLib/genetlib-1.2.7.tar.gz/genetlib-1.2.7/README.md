## `GENetLib`: A Python Library for Gene–environment Interaction Analysis via Deep Learning
``GENetLib`` is a Python library designed for gene-environment interaction analysis via neural network, addressing the analytical challenges in complex disease research. 
This package is capable of handling a variety of input data types:
- Scalar input data
- Functional input data (or densely measured data)

This package also supports diverse output requirements:
- Continuous output data
- Binary output data
- Survival output data

By integrating minimax concave penalty (MCP) and $L_2$-norm regularization within a neural network estimation framework, ``GENetLib`` offers an innovative solution for high-dimensional genetic data analysis. The framework is shown below.

We provide a web-based documentation which introduces the meaning of function parameters, the usage of functions, detailed information about methods, and gives examples for each. The web page is available at
[documentations](https://genetlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
This package has been uploaded to PyPI with previous versions, and the web page is available at
[PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/genetlib/). Users can also check [releases](https://github.com/Barry57/GENetLib/releases) to get historical versions.

## Features
``GENetLib`` has the following features:
- **Comprehensiveness**: Supports a variety of input and output formats, enabling the construction of comprehensive neural network models for G-E interaction analysis.
- **Flexibility**: Offers a multitude of parameters allowing users to build models flexibly according to their specific needs.
- **Functional data compatibility**: Implements methods for functional data analysis (FDA) in Python, facilitating the processing of functional data with Python.
- **Scalability**: New methods for G-E interaction analysis via deep learning can be easily integrated into the system.

## Installation
It is recommended to use ``pip`` for installation:
```c
pip install GENetLib
```
To get further information about installation and independencies, please move to [installation instructions](https://genetlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Quick Start
We start with the two basic functions ``scalar_ge`` and ``func_ge``.
### scalar_ge
``scalar_ge`` performs G-E interaction analysis via deep leanring when the input is scalar data.
```Python
from GENetLib.sim_data import sim_data_scalar
from GENetLib.scalar_ge import scalar_ge

# Get example data where input is scalar data and output is survival data
scalar_survival_linear = sim_data_scalar(rho_G = 0.25, rho_E = 0.3, dim_G = 500, dim_E = 5, n = 1500,
                                         dim_E_Sparse = 2, ytype = 'Survival', n_inter = 30)

# Set up the ScalerGE model
scalar_ge_res = scalar_ge(y = scalar_survival_linear['y'], G = scalar_survival_linear['G'], E = scalar_survival_linear['E'],
                          ytype = 'Survival',num_hidden_layers = 2, nodes_hidden_layer = [1000, 100], num_epochs = 100,
                          learning_rate1 = 0.06, learning_rate2 = 0.035, lambda1 = None, lambda2 = 0.09, Lambda = 0.1,
                          threshold = 0.01, split_type = 0, ratio = [7, 3], important_feature = True, plot = True)
```
### func_ge
``func_ge`` performs G-E interaction analysis via deep leanring when the input is functional data.
```Python
from GENetLib.sim_data import sim_data_func
from GENetLib.func_ge import func_ge

# Get example data where input is densely measured functional data and output is survival data
func_continuous = sim_data_func(n = 1500, m = 30, ytype = 'Continuous', seed = 123)

# Set up the FuncGE model
func_ge_res = func_ge(y = func_continuous['y'], X = func_continuous['X'], location = func_continuous['location'],
                      Z = func_continuous['Z'], ytype = 'Continuous', btype = 'Bspline', num_hidden_layers = 2,
                      nodes_hidden_layer = [100,10], num_epochs = 50, learning_rate1 = 0.02, learning_rate2 = 0.035,
                      nbasis1 = 5, params1 = 4, lambda1 = None, lambda2 = 0.01, Lambda = 0.01, Bsplines = 5,
                      norder1 = 4, split_type = 1, ratio = [3, 1, 1], plot_res = True)
```

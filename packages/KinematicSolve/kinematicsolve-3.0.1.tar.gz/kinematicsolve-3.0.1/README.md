# KinematicSolve

A Python module for solving kinematics problems. Supports **algebra-based uniform acceleration motion (UAM)**, **symbolic calculus**

---

## Features

- Algebraic solver for UAM problems (solve for displacement, velocity, acceleration, or time).  
- Symbolic solver for calculus-based kinematics problems with derivatives and integrals.  
- Initial condition support for velocity and displacement in symbolic mode.  
- Flexible input: works with partially known data; missing values are automatically computed.

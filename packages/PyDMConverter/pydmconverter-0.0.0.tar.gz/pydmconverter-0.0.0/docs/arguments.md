Pydmconverter supports a few optional startup arguments that allow users to execute specific actions when running the converter.

Below, you'll find a detailed overview of each available argument to help you use the converter as you need to.

## Override

`-o` or `--override`

This argument allows users to override the output file if it already exists. Most often this will be used with the scroll bar argument if it appears a screen exceeds the screen. This will replace the file with a new converted file.


## Scroll Bars

`-s` or `--scrollable`

This argument adds scroll bars to converted screens. It will ad a horizontal and vertical scroll bar. If this argument is not included, the screen will not contain a scroll bar.

## Help

`-h` or `--help`

This argument shows the converter's help message, which outlines the available arguments for users.

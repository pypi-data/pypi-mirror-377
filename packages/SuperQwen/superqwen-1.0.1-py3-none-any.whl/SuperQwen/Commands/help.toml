  # /sq:help - Command Reference Documentation

  ## Triggers
  - Command discovery and reference lookup requests
  - Framework exploration and capability understanding needs
  - Documentation requests for available SuperClaude commands

  ## Behavioral Flow
  1. **Display**: Present complete command list with descriptions
  2. **Complete**: End interaction after displaying information

  Key behaviors:
  - Information display only - no execution or implementation
  - Reference documentation mode without action triggers

  Here is a complete list of all available SuperQwen (`/sq`) commands.

  | Command | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `/sq:analyze` | Comprehensive code analysis across quality, security, performance, and architecture domains |
  | `/sq:build` | Build, compile, and package projects with intelligent error handling and optimization |

  | `/sq:design` | Design system architecture, APIs, and component interfaces with comprehensive specifications |
  | `/sq:document` | Generate focused documentation for components, functions, APIs, and features |
  | `/sq:estimate` | Provide development estimates for tasks, features, or projects with intelligent analysis |
  | `/sq:explain` | Provide clear explanations of code, concepts, and system behavior with educational clarity |
  | `/sq:git` | Git operations with intelligent commit messages and workflow optimization |
  | `/sq:help` | List all available /sq commands and their functionality |

Summary: TAELCORE 3 (Topological AutoEncoder with Best Linear Combination for Optimal Reduction of Dimension) is a novel dimensionality reduction technique designed specifically for high-dimensional datasets. By combining topological autoencoding with an optimized linear combination approach, TAELCORE 3 achieves efficient, accurate, and structure-preserving reduction, making it especially suitable for complex, large-scale databases.

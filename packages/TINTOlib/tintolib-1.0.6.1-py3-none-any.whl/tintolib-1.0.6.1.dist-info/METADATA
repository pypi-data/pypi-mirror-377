              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## 🧠 Overview

**TINTOlib** is a state-of-the-art Python library that transforms **tidy data** (also known as tabular data) into **synthetic images**, enabling the application of advanced deep learning techniques, including **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, to traditionally structured data. This transformation bridges the gap between tabular data and powerful vision-based machine learning models, unlocking new possibilities for tackling regression, classification, and other complex tasks.

## ⚠️ Platform-Specific Requirements for Certain Transformation Methods

Some transformation methods in TINTOlib have specific system requirements or limitations when used on platforms such as Google Colab, Windows, Linux, or macOS.

### REFINED

This method relies on `mpi4py`, which enables parallel computation using MPI (Message Passing Interface). However, `mpi4py` requires administrative permissions to utilize multiple processors, making it incompatible with platforms like Google Colab. 

- **Linux**:
  Ensure that the MPI environment is set up before installing `mpi4py`. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
      sudo apt-get install python3
      sudo apt install python3-pip
      sudo apt install python3-mpi4py
    ```
  Once MPI is installed:

    ```bash
      pip install mpi4py
    ```
- **MacOS / Windows:** Direct installation is usually supported:

    ```bash
      pip install mpi4py
    ```

### SuperTML

The **SuperTML** method generates text-based synthetic images and requires the **MS Sans Serif** font.

- On **Windows**, this font is typically available by default.
- On **Linux** and **macOS**, it must be installed manually to avoid rendering issues.

#### Font Installation

- **Linux**: Install Microsoft Core Fonts:
  
    ```bash
      sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
    ```

On **Google Colab**, installing additional fonts is not permitted due to administrative restrictions.

## 📄 Getting Started

- You can install TINTOlib using **[Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/TINTOlib/)**:
    ```bash
      pip install TINTOlib
    ```

TINTOlib already includes all necessary dependencies, so there’s no need to install them individually.

However, if you prefer manual installation or want to explore the full environment:

- The repository includes a `requirements.txt` file listing the **core dependencies** required to use TINTOlib. You can directly run the **TINTOlib-example.ipynb** notebook located in the examples/ folder using the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Other notebooks**, which include training deep learning models on the generated images, require additional libraries. To run them, install the extended dependencies from `requirements-example.txt`:

## 🧩 Importing a Specific Model

- To use a specific image transformation model, import it directly. For example, to use **TINTO**:

    ```python
      from TINTOlib.tinto import TINTO
    ```

- To import a specific model use: 
    ```python
      from TINTOlib.tinto import TINTO
    ```

- Create the model. If you don't set any hyperparameter, the model will use the default values, refer to the **[Models Section](#models)** or the **[TINTO Documentation](https://tintolib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**.

    ```python
      model = TINTO(problem="supervised", blur=True)
    ```

## 🔧 Generating Synthetic Images
To generate synthetic images, use the following workflow with the `fit`, `transform`, and `fit_transform` methods:

**Parameters**:
- **data**: A path to a CSV file or a Pandas DataFrame  (target column must be the last column).
- **folder**: Path to the folder where the synthetic images will be saved.

#### Sintaxis

1. The `fit` method trains the model on the tabular data and prepares it for image generation.
    ```python
      model.fit(data)
    ```

2. The `transform` method generates and saves synthetic images in a specified folder. It requires the model to be fitted first.
    ```python
      model.transform(data, folder)
    ```

3. The `fit_transform` method combines the training and image generation steps. It fits the model to the data and generates synthetic images in one step.

  ```python
    model.fit_transform(data, folder)
  ```

#### Notes:
- **The model must be fitted** before using the `transform` method. If the model isn't fitted, a `RuntimeError` will be raised.


### Iris dataset Example
To get started with **TINTOlib**, a dedicated **[Crash Course Repository](https://github.com/oeg-upm/TINTOlib-Crash_Course)** is available. It includes videoturials, slides and Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to apply state-of-the-art vision models like Vision Transformers (ViTs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Hybrid Neural Networks to problems.
<!--It includes:

- **Slides and Jupyter notebooks** demonstrating how to:
  - Transform tabular data into images using **TINTOlib**.
  - Apply state-of-the-art vision models like **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classification and regression problems.

- Integration of **Hybrid Neural Networks (HyNNs)**, where:
  - **One branch** (MLP) processes the original tabular data.
  - **Another branch** (CNN or ViT) processes synthetic images.

This architecture leverages the strengths of both tabular and image-based data representations, enabling improved performance on complex machine learning tasks. The repository is ideal for those looking to integrate image-based deep learning techniques into tabular data workflows.
-->

For example, the following table shows a classic example of the [IRIS CSV dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) as it should look like for the run:


| sepal length | sepal width | petal length | petal width | target |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| 4.9 | 3.0 | 1.4 | 0.2 | 1 |
| 7.0 | 3.2 | 4.7 | 1.4 | 2 |
| 6.3 | 3.3 | 6.0 | 2.5 | 3 |


- The following example shows how to execute TINTOlib using the TINTO method and then display the synthetic image generated for the first row:

    ```python
      model = TINTO(problem="supervised", pixel=30, algorithm="t-SNE", steps=5, blur=True)
      model.fit_transform("iris.csv", "synthetic_images")
    ```

<!--
- **Blurring (-B)**: Create the images with blurring technique.
- **Dimensional Reduction Algorithm (-alg)**: t-SNE is used.
- **Blurring option (-oB)**: Create de images with maximum value of overlaping pixel
- **Image size (-px)**: 30x30 pixels
- **Blurring steps (-sB)**: Expand 5 pixels the blurring.

    A Python package for survival analysis with competing risks, integrating neural networks and statistical inference. 
    Provides tools for time-to-event prediction, model training with PyTorch backend, and comprehensive hypothesis testing.

    Key Features:
    - Neural network models for time-varying and non-time-varying survival analysis
    - Prediction metrics including time-dependent AUC and C-index calculation
    - Bootstrap-based hypothesis testing (structure & significance tests) for model validation

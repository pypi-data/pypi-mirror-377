## ✨ Features in Depth

-   **Modern & Responsive UI**: Clean, beautiful, and mobile-friendly interface built with Bootstrap. It includes a dark mode theme and a fully responsive layout that works on any device.

-   **Universal Support**:
    -   **YouTube Search**: Find any video on YouTube directly from the app.
    -   **Direct URL Support**: Paste a video, playlist, or channel URL from hundreds of websites supported by `yt-dlp`.

-   **Direct Streaming**: Why wait? Play videos and audio directly in your browser with a multi-stage loading animation that provides clear feedback. It intelligently handles sites that don't support direct streaming.

-   **Advanced Downloads**:
    -   **Format Selection**: Choose the exact video quality, audio quality, or file format you need.
    -   **Playlist & Channel Downloading**: Paste a playlist or channel URL, select the videos you want, and download them all in one go.
    -   **One-Click Audio**: A dedicated "Get Audio" button streamlines downloading music and podcasts.
    -   **Subtitle Support**: Automatically fetches available subtitle languages and allows you to embed them directly into your downloaded video file.

-   **Robust Download Management**:
    -   **Background Queue**: Add multiple items to a download queue that processes sequentially in the background, so you can keep browsing.
    -   **Live Progress**: The UI dynamically updates to show real-time download progress, speed, and ETA without needing a page refresh.
    -   **File Management**: View, download, and delete your completed files directly from the web interface.

-   **Secure & Maintainable**:
    -   **Self-Hosted**: You control your data. Run it on your own machine, home server, or in the cloud.
    -   **Password Protection**: An optional password can be set to protect access to the dashboard.
    -   **Auto-Update Notifications**: The app automatically checks for new versions on PyPI and will prompt for an update, ensuring you're always on the latest stable release.

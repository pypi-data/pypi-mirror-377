~$ tuned -f 442
```

To change the detection mode:

- Chord detection:

Identifies the played chord and details its component notes.

~$ tuned -m chord
```

- Note detection (default value):

Detects the played note and shows its tuning accuracy.

```bash
~$ tuned -m note
```

You can change the information to display:

```bash
~$ tuned -v
```

- **-v**: Show precision (current value between played note and target note).
- **-vv**: Show precision and current note frequency.
- **-vvv**: Show precision, frequency and current level signal.
- **-vvvv**: Show precision, frequency, level signal and the execution time of the played note calculation.

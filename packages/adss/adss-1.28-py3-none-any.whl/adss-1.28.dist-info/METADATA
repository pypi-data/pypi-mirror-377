# ADSS
Astronomical Data Smart System

ADSS is a database/server project hosted at CBPF (Brazilian Center for Research in Physics) that provides access to astronomical data from different surveys. 

This repository provides a set of tools for querying astronomical ADSS services using ADQL. You can perform cone searches, cross-match queries between tables, and even cross-match against user-supplied data. The library supports both synchronous and asynchronous query execution.

## Instalation

```bash
pip install adss
```

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schwarzam/adss.git
cd adss

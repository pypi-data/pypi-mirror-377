# Afnio: Making AI System Optimization Easy for Everyone

Afnio is a framework for automatic prompt and hyperparameter optimization, particularly designed for complex AI systems where Language Models (LMs) are employed multiple times in workflows, such as in LM pipelines and agent-driven architectures. Effortlessly build and optimize AI systems for classification, information retrieval, question-answering, etc.

- **Accelerated AI System Development:** Ship complex AI systems faster thanks to high-level UX and easy-to-debug runtime.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Leverage built-in optimizers to automatically refine prompts and tune model parameters for any LM task, ensuring optimal performance.
- **LM Agnostic:** Decouple prompts and parameters from application logic, reducing LM model selection to a single hyperparameter in Afnio’s optimizers. Seamlessly switch between models without any additional rework.
- **Minimal and Flexible:** Pure Python with no API calls or dependencies, ensuring seamless integration with any tools or libraries.
- **Progressive Disclosure of Complexity:** Leverage diverse UX workflows, from high-level abstractions to fine-grained control, designed to suit various user profiles. Start simple and customize as needed, without ever feeling like you’re falling off a complexity cliff.
- **_Define-by-Run_ Scheme:** Your compound AI system is dynamically defined at runtime through forward computation, allowing for seamless handling of complex control flows like conditionals and loops, common in agent-based AI applications. With no need for precompilation, Afnio adapts on the fly to your evolving system.

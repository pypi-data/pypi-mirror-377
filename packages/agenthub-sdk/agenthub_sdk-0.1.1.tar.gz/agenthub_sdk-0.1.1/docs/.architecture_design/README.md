## üìä **Architecture Summary**

### **System Overview**
Agent Hub is a CLI-based platform for discovering, installing, and managing AI agents with one-line integration. The architecture uses:

- **Process-based isolation** for agent execution
- **GitHub-based registry** for zero-maintenance operations
- **UV package manager** for fast dependency management
- **Local execution** for development speed and privacy

### **Key Design Principles**
1. **Simplicity First** - Use proven, simple technologies
2. **Developer Experience** - Optimize for fast iteration and ease of use
3. **Zero Maintenance** - Minimize operational overhead
4. **Extensibility** - Clear path for future enhancements

### **Success Metrics**
- **Agent installation**: < 10 seconds
- **Integration time**: < 5 minutes from discovery to usage
- **Developer adoption**: Low barrier to entry with templates
- **System reliability**: 99.9% uptime (leveraging GitHub infrastructure)

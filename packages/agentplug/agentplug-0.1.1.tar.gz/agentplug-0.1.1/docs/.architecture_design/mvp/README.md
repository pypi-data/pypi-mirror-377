**Document Type**: MVP Architecture Index  
**Author**: William  
**Date Created**: 2025-06-28  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-28  
**Status**: Final  
**Purpose**: MVP-focused architecture documentation for Agent Hub  

## 🎯 **MVP Overview**

Agent Hub MVP focuses on **validating the core integration experience** - transforming AI agent integration from weeks of custom development into a simple, one-line experience: `agent = amg.load("meta/coding-agent")`.

### **MVP Scope**
- ✅ **Core Runtime**: Process-based agent execution with isolation
- ✅ **CLI Interface**: Basic agent lifecycle management
- ✅ **GitHub Registry**: Simple agent discovery (no search)
- ✅ **SDK Integration**: One-line agent loading
- ✅ **Tool Infrastructure**: Tool discovery, injection, and validation framework
- ❌ **Agent Search**: Not needed for MVP validation
- ❌ **Community Features**: Post-MVP enhancement
- ❌ **Centralized Tools**: Tools are implemented inside agents

### **MVP Success Criteria**
- **Integration Success Rate**: 90%+ successful installations
- **Time to Integration**: < 5 minutes from discovery to usage
- **Developer Adoption**: 10+ agents published in first month
- **Technical Success**: One-line loading, dependency isolation, fast execution

## 🏗️ **MVP Architecture Principles**

### **1. Simplicity First**
- Use proven, simple technologies over complex solutions
- Focus on core functionality, not edge cases
- Minimize dependencies and complexity

### **2. MVP Validation Focus**
- Build only what's needed to validate core value proposition
- Defer non-essential features to post-MVP
- Prioritize user feedback over feature completeness

### **3. Developer Experience**
- Optimize for fast iteration and ease of use
- Target developer audience with CLI-first approach
- Provide clear error messages and solutions

### **4. Zero Maintenance**
- Leverage GitHub infrastructure for registry
- Minimize operational overhead
- Design for self-service usage

### **5. Agent Autonomy**
- Agents implement their own tools internally
- Agent Hub provides tool infrastructure, not tool implementations
- Each agent is self-contained with its own toolset

## 🚀 **MVP Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Process manager for subprocess execution
- Virtual environment management with UV
- Basic agent loading and execution

### **Phase 2: CLI Interface (Week 3)**
- Install, list, remove commands
- Local agent storage and management
- Error handling and logging

### **Phase 3: GitHub Integration (Week 4)**
- Simple GitHub-based registry client
- Basic agent discovery (listing only)
- Registry caching

### **Phase 4: SDK & Polish (Weeks 5-6)**
- Python SDK with one-line loading
- Method dispatching and execution
- Documentation and examples

## 📊 **MVP Architecture Summary**

### **System Overview**
Agent Hub MVP is a CLI-based platform for installing and managing AI agents with one-line integration. The MVP uses:

- **Process-based isolation** for agent execution
- **GitHub-based registry** for zero-maintenance operations
- **UV package manager** for fast dependency management
- **Local execution** for development speed and privacy

### **Key MVP Design Decisions**
1. **Process Isolation**: Subprocess execution with virtual environments
2. **CLI-First**: Command-line interface for developer audience
3. **Local Execution**: All agents run locally for fast iteration
4. **GitHub Registry**: Simple JSON-based registry without search
5. **No Search**: Focus on integration, not discovery
6. **Agent Autonomy**: Agents implement their own tools internally
7. **Tool Infrastructure**: Agent Hub provides framework, not implementations
8. **KISS Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - minimal complexity
9. **YAGNI Principle**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - no unnecessary features

### **MVP Success Metrics**
- **Agent installation**: < 10 seconds
- **Integration time**: < 5 minutes from discovery to usage
- **Developer adoption**: Low barrier to entry with templates
- **System reliability**: 99.9% uptime (leveraging GitHub infrastructure)

      "content": "Implement comprehensive performance optimization across all application layers with multi-level caching strategies and resource optimization. For frontend: use code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, efficient bundling, and minimize render blocking resources. For backend/database: optimize queries with proper indexing, connection pooling, query analysis, and implement caching strategies including CDNs, application caches, and database query caches with appropriate cache invalidation and TTL settings. Use performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks including slow database queries, computationally expensive algorithms, and memory leaks. Integrate static analysis with dynamic profiling for comprehensive performance assessment. Optimize resource usage with efficient algorithms, memory management, CPU utilization, and implement resource pooling where appropriate. Establish performance budgets and benchmarks, monitor performance metrics continuously, and implement alerting for performance regressions.",

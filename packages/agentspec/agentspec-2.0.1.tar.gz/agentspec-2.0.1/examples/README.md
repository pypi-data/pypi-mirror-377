- **Mobile applications** → Mobile App Development

### 2. Follow the Step-by-Step Process

Each example follows the same structured approach:

1. **Project Setup** - Initialize with AgentSpec template
2. **Specification Review** - Understand generated guidelines
3. **Project Structure** - Organize code following best practices
4. **Development Workflow** - Implement features systematically
5. **Testing Strategy** - Comprehensive testing approach
6. **Deployment & Infrastructure** - Production-ready deployment
7. **Validation & QA** - Quality assurance and monitoring

### 3. Adapt to Your Environment

Each example includes environment-specific usage guidelines for:

#### Amazon Kiro IDE

```bash
# Use AgentSpec specifications as context for AI-assisted development
# Reference quality gates for automated validation
# Follow implementation frameworks for systematic development
```

#### Microsoft SpecKit

```bash
# Import specifications for enterprise project management
# Use quality gates for compliance checking
# Leverage testing frameworks for comprehensive validation
```

#### VS Code with GitHub Copilot

```bash
# Use specifications as context for better AI suggestions
# Reference coding standards when accepting AI-generated code
# Follow security guidelines for safe AI-assisted development
```

### 4. Customize for Your Needs

All examples are designed to be customized:

- **Modify templates** to match your specific requirements
- **Adapt workflows** to your team's development process
- **Extend testing strategies** based on your quality standards
- **Adjust deployment** for your infrastructure preferences

## Common Patterns Across Examples

### Project Context Management

All examples demonstrate systematic project context management through comprehensive documentation and structured development approaches.
```

### Quality Gates

Every example enforces consistent quality standards:

1. **Zero Errors** - No linting, compilation, or runtime errors
2. **Test Coverage** - Comprehensive testing with high coverage
3. **Documentation** - Up-to-date documentation and API specs
4. **Security** - Security best practices and vulnerability scanning
5. **Performance** - Performance benchmarks and optimization

### Validation Framework

All examples include comprehensive validation:

```bash
# Pre-Development Checklist
- [ ] Load existing project context
- [ ] Analyze requirements thoroughly
- [ ] Define clear exit criteria

# During Implementation
- [ ] Update project context regularly
- [ ] Run tests continuously
- [ ] Validate integration points

# Post-Task Validation

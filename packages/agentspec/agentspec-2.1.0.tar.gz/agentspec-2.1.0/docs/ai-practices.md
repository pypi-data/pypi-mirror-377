# AI Best Practices with AgentSpec

This guide covers best practices for using AgentSpec with AI coding assistants to get professional-quality code.

## Why AI Needs Instructions

AI coding assistants are powerful, but without proper guidance they often produce:
- Basic examples instead of production-ready code
- Inconsistent coding styles
- Missing security practices
- Incomplete error handling
- No testing or documentation

AgentSpec solves this by providing detailed instructions that guide AI to write professional code.

## Getting Started with AI + AgentSpec

### Step 1: Generate Instructions

```bash
# For a React project
agentspec generate --template react_app --output instructions.md

# For a Python API
agentspec generate --template python-api --output instructions.md
```

### Step 2: Share with Your AI Assistant

**With ChatGPT or Claude:**
1. Copy the entire contents of your instructions file
2. Start your conversation with: "Please follow these AgentSpec instructions for all code you write:"
3. Paste the instructions
4. Then ask for what you need

**With GitHub Copilot:**
1. Keep the instructions file open in your editor
2. Copilot will use it as context automatically
3. Reference specific sections when needed

**With Cursor or other AI IDEs:**
1. Add the instructions file to your project
2. Reference it when asking for help: "Following the instructions in instructions.md, help me..."

## Best Practices for AI Collaboration

### 1. Always Start with Instructions

Never ask AI to write code without first providing AgentSpec instructions. This ensures consistency and quality from the beginning.

**Bad:**
```
"Create a React login form"
```

**Good:**
```
"Following the AgentSpec instructions I provided, create a React login form with proper validation, accessibility, and testing"
```

### 2. Reference Specific Sections

When asking for help, reference specific sections of your instructions:

```
"Following the React Component Architecture section in the instructions, create a reusable Button component"

"Using the Security Best Practices guidelines, implement user authentication"

"Following the Testing Strategy section, write tests for this component"
```

### 3. Validate AI Output

Always check that AI-generated code follows your instructions:

- ✅ Does it include proper error handling?
- ✅ Are there tests included?
- ✅ Is it accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)?
- ✅ Does it follow security practices?
- ✅ Is it properly documented?

### 4. Iterative Improvement

Use AgentSpec's quality gates to improve code iteratively:

```
"The code looks good, but following the Quality Gates in the instructions, please add:
1. Input validation
2. Error boundaries
3. Loading states
4. Accessibility attributes"
```

## AI-Specific Instructions

AgentSpec includes special instructions for AI collaboration:

### Human-in-the-Loop Architecture
- Maintain developer control over AI assistance
- Never commit code you don't understand
- Always review AI suggestions before accepting

### Prompt Engineering Discipline
- Use structured prompts with clear requirements
- Reference specific instruction sections
- Ask for explanations of complex code

### Context Management
- Keep project context updated
- Reference previous decisions and patterns
- Maintain consistency across sessions

## Common AI Collaboration Patterns

### 1. Feature Development

```
1. "Following the AgentSpec instructions, help me plan the architecture for [feature]"
2. "Now implement the [component] following the Component Architecture guidelines"
3. "Add tests following the Testing Strategy section"
4. "Review the code against the Quality Gates checklist"
```

### 2. Code Review

```
"Review this code against the AgentSpec instructions and identify any missing:
- Error handling
- Security practices
- Accessibility features
- Testing coverage
- Documentation"
```

### 3. Debugging

```
"Following the Error Handling guidelines in the instructions, help me debug this issue and implement proper error recovery"
```

### 4. Refactoring

```
"Following the Code Quality and Architecture guidelines, help me refactor this code to be more maintainable and follow best practices"
```

## Quality Assurance with AI

### Automated Validation

Use AgentSpec's validation framework to check AI-generated code:

```bash
# Run quality checks
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run type-check
npm run build

# Security scanning
npm audit
```

### Manual Review Checklist

For each AI-generated piece of code, verify:

- [ ] **Functionality**: Does it work as expected?
- [ ] **Security**: Are inputs validated? No hardcoded secrets?
- [ ] **Performance**: Is it optimized? No obvious bottlenecks?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation?
- [ ] **Testing**: Are there comprehensive tests?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is it properly documented?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and recovery?

## Advanced AI Collaboration

### 1. Multi-Step Development

Break complex features into steps, each following AgentSpec guidelines:

```
"Following the AgentSpec instructions, let's build a user authentication system:

Step 1: Design the database schema following the Database Design guidelines
Step 2: Implement the API endpoints following the API Design section
Step 3: Create the frontend components following the Component Architecture
Step 4: Add comprehensive tests following the Testing Strategy
Step 5: Implement security measures following the Security Best Practices"
```

### 2. Cross-Reference Validation

Have AI validate its own work against instructions:

```
"Review the code you just wrote against these specific AgentSpec sections:
1. Security Best Practices
2. Error Handling
3. Performance Optimization
4. Accessibility Compliance

Identify any gaps and provide fixes."
```

### 3. Documentation Generation

Use AI to generate documentation that follows AgentSpec standards:

```
"Following the Documentation Standards in the AgentSpec instructions, generate comprehensive documentation for this API including:
- API reference
- Usage examples
- Error codes
- Security considerations"
```

## Team Collaboration with AI

### Shared Instructions

Use the same AgentSpec instructions across your team:

```bash
# Generate team-wide standards
agentspec generate --template enterprise-web-application --output team-standards.md

# Share team-standards.md with all developers
# Everyone uses the same instructions with their AI assistants
```

### Code Review Process

Include AgentSpec compliance in code reviews:

1. **Developer**: Uses AgentSpec instructions with AI
2. **AI**: Generates code following instructions
3. **Developer**: Reviews against AgentSpec quality gates
4. **Team**: Reviews for AgentSpec compliance
5. **Merge**: Only after passing all quality gates

### Knowledge Sharing

Document AI collaboration patterns:

```markdown

2. Ask AI for implementation
3. Validate against quality gates
4. Review with team
5. Document lessons learned
```

## Troubleshooting AI Collaboration

### AI Not Following Instructions

**Problem**: AI ignores AgentSpec guidelines
**Solution**:
- Make instructions more explicit in your prompt
- Reference specific sections: "Following section 3.2 of the instructions..."
- Break down requests into smaller, more specific tasks

### Inconsistent Code Quality

**Problem**: AI produces varying quality code
**Solution**:
- Always start conversations with full AgentSpec instructions
- Use the same prompt structure for similar tasks
- Validate against quality gates after each AI response

### Missing Context

**Problem**: AI doesn't understand project context
**Solution**:
- Include project context in your AgentSpec instructions
- Reference existing code patterns
- Use `agentspec analyze .` to generate project-specific instructions

### Security Concerns

**Problem**: Worried about AI-generated security vulnerabilities
**Solution**:
- Always use AgentSpec security instructions
- Run security scans on AI-generated code
- Have security-focused code reviews
- Use the `security-focused-development` template for critical applications

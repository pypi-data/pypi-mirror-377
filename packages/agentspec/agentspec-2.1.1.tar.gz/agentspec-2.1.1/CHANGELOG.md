## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1] - 2025-09-16

### Fixed
- **Logging System Improvements**: Resolved issue where log files were created in user's current working directory
  - Log files are now only created when `AGENTSPEC_DEBUG_LOGGING=1` environment variable is set
  - When enabled, log files are stored in the AgentSpec installation directory (`agentspec/logs/`) instead of cluttering user workspaces
  - Regular operation now uses console-only logging to keep user directories clean
  - Added comprehensive logging documentation and troubleshooting guide
  - Maintains backward compatibility with custom log file parameter for advanced users

### Added
- Environment-controlled debug logging with `AGENTSPEC_DEBUG_LOGGING` environment variable
- Centralized log directory in installation path with automatic creation
- Detailed logging documentation in `agentspec/logs/README.md`
- Enhanced API documentation with logging examples and best practices

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Integrated AI best practices functionality into main CLI
  - Removed standalone `scripts/integrate_ai_best_practices.py` script
  - Added `agentspec integrate` command with same functionality
  - Improved architectural consistency across all AgentSpec features

### Added (Previous)
- Comprehensive test coverage for `agentspec integrate` command
- Detailed AI integration documentation (`docs/ai-integration.md`)
- JSON output support for programmatic integration analysis
- Enhanced CLI help text with integrate command examples

### Fixed (Previous)
- Architectural inconsistency where AI integration was a separate script
- Missing documentation for AI best practices integration workflow

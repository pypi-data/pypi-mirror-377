    Write a filtered GFA file by excluding lines that involve specified segments.

    This function processes a GFA file line by line, excluding:
    - `S` lines (segments) whose ID is in `segments_to_remove`
    - `L`, `J`, and `C` lines (links, joins, containments) involving any removed segments
    - `P` and `W` lines (paths, walks) that contain any removed segment IDs

    All other lines (including headers or comments) are preserved.

    Parameters
    ----------
    segments_to_remove : set[str]
        Segment IDs that should be removed from the graph.
    gfa_file : str
        Path to the input GFA file.
    output_path : str
        Directory where the filtered GFA file will be written.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Full path to the written filtered GFA file.

    $ pip install ai-marketplace-monitor

Install Playwright browser:

.. code-block:: console

    $ playwright install

Step 2: Set Up Notifications (Optional)
---------------------------------------

Choose one notification method:

**PushBullet** (Recommended for beginners):
1. Sign up at `pushbullet.com <https://www.pushbullet.com/>`_
2. Install the app on your phone
3. Get your API token from the website

**Email**:
1. Use your existing email account
2. Get SMTP settings from your email provider
3. For Gmail, create an app password

Step 3: Create Configuration
---------------------------

Create the configuration directory:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir -p ~/.ai-marketplace-monitor

Create a minimal configuration file at ``~/.ai-marketplace-monitor/config.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

    [marketplace.facebook]
    search_city = 'houston'  # Replace with your city

    [item.gopro]
    search_phrases = 'Go Pro Hero 11'
    min_price = 100
    max_price = 300

    [user.me]
    pushbullet_token = 'your_pushbullet_token_here'

.. note::
   Replace ``'houston'`` with your city name and ``'your_pushbullet_token_here'`` with your actual PushBullet token.

Step 4: Add AI Service (Optional but Recommended)
------------------------------------------------

Sign up for an AI service like `OpenAI <https://openai.com/>`_ or `DeepSeek <https://www.deepseek.com/>`_ and add to your config:

.. code-block:: toml

    [ai.openai]
    api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

    # ... rest of your config

Step 5: Run the Monitor
----------------------

Start monitoring:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ai-marketplace-monitor

What happens next:

1. **Browser Opens**: A browser window will appear
2. **Login Prompt**: Enter Facebook credentials if prompted
3. **CAPTCHA**: Complete any CAPTCHA challenges
4. **Monitoring Starts**: The program begins searching automatically
5. **Notifications**: You'll receive notifications when matches are found

Step 6: Test Your Setup
-----------------------

To verify everything works, check a specific listing:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ai-marketplace-monitor --check https://facebook.com/marketplace/item/123456789

Example Output
-------------

When the monitor finds a matching item, you'll see console output like:

.. code-block:: text

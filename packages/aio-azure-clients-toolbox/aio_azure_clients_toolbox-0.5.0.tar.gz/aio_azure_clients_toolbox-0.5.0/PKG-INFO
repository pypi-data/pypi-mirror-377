              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Async Azure Clients Toolboox

This library includes wrappers for various async Azure Python clients. These are the ones we have used most commonly in our projects at Mulligan Funding.

This library has been open-sourced because it includes a "connection pooling" implementation that other developers may find useful or instructive ([see module here](./aio_azure_clients_toolbox/connection_pooling.py)).

In addition to the client-wrappers included here, we also have testing utilities to make this library more convenient to use with `pytest` (see below).

See below for introduction to the various modules available.

## Installation

```sh
pip install "aio-azure-clients-toolbox"

```

This will install the following libraries into your project (links go to examples below):

- azure-identity
- [azure-cosmos](#cosmos)
- [azure-eventgrid](#eventgrid)
- [azure-eventhub](#eventhub)
- [azure-servicebus](#service-bus)
- [azure-storage-blob](#azure-blobs)

**Note**: this library does not currently offer a way to select only some of these clients.

---

## Clients

This section describes the clients included here and offers suggestions on how to use them in your projects.

**Note**: All clients included here use a `DefaultAzureCredential` to connect to their resources.

**This is not configurable**.

**Note**: most of the examples below are primarily using the `Managed` clients (non-managed clients also exist). These will _open_ async connections and _keep_ them open in a connection-pooling. When connections are opened and closed they cannot be used. In addition, after opening, the clients must signal readiness by running their "ready" action. This typically means _sending_ a test message to confirm that the connection is live.

### Azure Blobs

This library includes an Azure Blob Storage client that contains common functionality such as the following:

- `upload_blob`
- `download_blob` (to bytes in memory)
- `download_blob_to_dir` (download a file to a directory)
- `delete_blob`
- `get_blob_sas_token`
- `get_blob_sas_token_list`
- `get_blob_sas_url`
- `get_blob_sas_url_list`

You can create and use this client like this:

```python
import aiofiles
import os
import tempfile

from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
from aio_azure_clients_toolbox import AzureBlobStorageClient
from aio_azure_clients_toolbox.clients.azure_blobs import AzureBlobError  # reexport


class AzureBlobStorageClient(AzureBlobStorageClient):
    CONTAINER_NAME = "some-container"
    __slots__ = [
        "file_workspace_dir",
    ]

    def __init__(
        self,
        az_storage_url: str,
        az_credential: DefaultAzureCredential,
        file_workspace_dir: str = "/tmp",
    ):
        super().__init__(
            az_storage_url,
            self.CONTAINER_NAME,
            az_credential
        )
        self.file_workspace_dir = file_workspace_dir

    async def download_document_to_workspace(self, name: str, storage_path: str) -> str:
        """
        Download Blob to a temporary directory.

        Tempdir is used to write to a directory without race conditions on cleanup/overwrite.

        Caller is responsible for cleaning up tempdir!
        """

        tempdir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=self.file_workspace_dir)
        save_path = os.path.join(tempdir, name)

        # Write file into file path in tempdir
        async with aiofiles.open(save_path, "wb") as fl:
            async with self.get_blob_client(  # This method returns a blob client
                storage_path
            ) as client:  # type: BlobClient
                stream = await client.download_blob()
                # Read data in chunks to avoid loading all into memory at once
                async for chunk in stream.chunks():
                    # `chunk` is a byte array
                    await fl.write(chunk)

        return save_path

```

### Cosmos

This library includes a Cosmos client that offers persistent connections up to a refresh timelimit.

You can use it like this:

```python
from aio_azure_clients_toolbox import ManagedCosmos

# This client can be subclassed
class Cosmos(ManagedCosmos):
    container_name: str = "documents"
    MatchConditions = MatchConditions

    def __init__(self, settings: Optional[config.Config] = None):
        super().__init__(
            settings.cosmos_endpoint,
            settings.cosmos_dbname,
            self.container_name,
            settings.az_credential(),
        )

    async def insert_doc(self, document: dict):
        """
        This method inserts a document
        """
        # This class provides an async context manager for connecting
        # to your container
        async with self.get_container_client() as client:
            return await client.create_item(body=document)

```

### Eventgrid

This library includes a custom event grid client that wraps the official azure event grid client. The primary advantage of this client is that it allows a single client instance to emit events to multiple topics. Additionally it supports both async/sync modes depending on how it's constructed.

Azure managed identities is required to use this client. Here is an async example for setting and emiting and event using the client:

```python
from aio_azure_clients_toolbox.clients.eventgrid import EventGridClient, EventGridTopicConfig, EventGridConfig

from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential

eventgrid_config = EventGridConfig(
    [
        EventGridTopicConfig(
            "topic1", "https://topic1.azure.net/api/event",
        ),
        EventGridTopicConfig("topic2", "https://topic2.azure.net/api/event",
        ),
    ]
)

client = EventGridClient(eventgrid_config, async_credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
await client.async_emit_event(
      "topic2",
      "topic2-event-type",
      "topic2-subject",
      {},
  )
```

### Eventhub

```python
import json

from aio_azure_clients_toolbox.clients.eventhub import ManagedAzureEventhubProducer

client = ManagedEventhubProducer(
    eventhub_namespace,
    eventhub_name,
    az_credential(),
    eventhub_transport_type,
    ready_message='{"eventType": "connection-established"}'
)

async def send_something(event: dict):
    return await client.send_event(json.dumps(event))
```

### Service Bus

```python
import contextlib

from aio_azure_clients_toolbox import ManagedAzureServiceBusSender

sbus_client = AzureServiceBus(
    service_bus_namespace_url,
    service_bus_queue_name,
    az_credential()
)


# We can use this in our endpoints like this:
async def some_handler(request):
  await sbus_client.send_message("Some Message!")


# We can launch a listener like this:
async def run_service_bus_receiver(self):
  """Task-Worker processing message queue loop"""
  async with app.sbus_client.get_receiver() as receiver:
      async for msg in receiver:
        await handler_message(msg, receiver)

```

---

## Writing Tests

This library comes with a set of commonly-written (for us) pytest fixtures. You can load and use these in your `tests/conftest.py` module like this:

```python
pytest_plugins = [
    "aio_azure_clients_toolbox.testing_utils.fixtures",
]
```

After that, you can use the [fixtures provided here](./aio_azure_clients_toolbox/testing_utils/fixtures.py) as you would use any pytest fixture. Here's an example:

```python
# This test uses blob client fixture

async def test_get_blob_sas_token(absc, mock_azureblob, mocksas):
    mockgen, fake_token = mocksas
    _, mockblobc, _ = mock_azureblob
    mockblobc.account_name = "some-blobs"

    result = await absc.get_blob_sas_token("bla")
    assert result == fake_token

    result2 = await absc.get_blob_sas_url("bla")
    assert result2.endswith(f"some-blobs/bla?{fake_token}")

    # check mocked function to see what it was called with
    mockgen.call_count == 1
    call = mockgen.call_args_list[0]
    permission = call[1]["permission"]
    assert permission.read and not permission.write


async def test_download_blob(absc, mock_azureblob):
    _, _, set_return = mock_azureblob
    set_return.download_blob_returns(b"HEY")
    assert await absc.download_blob("some-blob") == b"HEY"


@pytest.fixture()
def cos_client(test_config):
    return cosmos.Cosmos(test_config)


# This test is using cosmos client fixture
async def test_insert_doc(cosmos_insertable, cos_client, document: dict):
    """Test insert document as expected"""
    # `cosmos_insertable` is a fixture provided by this library
    container_client, set_return = cosmos_insertable
    set_return("hello")
    result = await cos_client.insert_doc(document)
    assert result == "hello"
    call = container_client.method_calls[0]
    submitted = call[2]["body"]
    assert submitted == document

# This one uses our fake service bus fixture
async def test_send_message(sbus):
    await sbus.send_message("hey")
```

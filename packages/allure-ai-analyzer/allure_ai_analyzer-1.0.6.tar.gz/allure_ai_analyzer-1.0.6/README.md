## Features

✨ **Interactive HTML Dashboard:** Clearly displays grouped failures with expandable details, including stack traces and examples.

🤖 **Integrated AI Analyst (Powered by Gemini):**
- **Conversational Memory:** Engage in a stateful conversation. The AI remembers the context of previous messages for follow-up questions.
- **Autonomous Tool Use:** The AI agent proactively uses a toolbox of functions to access historical data, analyze trends, and answer complex questions.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Ask complex questions like "What's the difference between the last two reports?" or "What was the most common error this week?"

🚀 **Proactive Executive Summary:** On report load, the AI automatically analyzes the latest run and provides a summary of key insights directly in the chat. (This can be disabled in `config.yaml`).

📊 **Visual Data Dashboard:**
- Get immediate visual insights into your test data.
- **Failures by Epic Chart:** A bar chart showing the total number of failures categorized by their associated 'epic' label.
- **Status Breakdown Chart:** A doughnut chart visualizing the ratio of 'failed' vs. 'broken' tests.

📈 **Historical Trend Analysis:**
- The AI can analyze the entire report history to identify patterns.
- Ask about failure trends, the recurrence of specific bugs, and the impact of fixes over time.

> If you ship package data (templates, static assets, YAML config), make sure they live **under** `src/allure_analyzer/...` so they are included in wheels.

-----

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (the package requires `>=3.11`)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- An **Allure results** directory generated from a test run.

> macOS tip (Homebrew): `brew install python@3.11`

-----

## Installation

### Stable (PyPI)
Once released to PyPI (production), installation is simply:
```bash
pip install allure-ai-analyzer
```

### Preview / Testing (TestPyPI)
When installing from **TestPyPI**, use PyPI as a **fallback for dependencies** (so wheels like `PyYAML>=6.0` are available):
```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple \
  allure-ai-analyzer
```

> Why the extra index? TestPyPI often doesn’t host all dependency wheels. The extra index lets pip fetch deps from PyPI while your package still comes from TestPyPI.

-----

## Quickstart

1) **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2) **Install the CLI:**
```bash
pip install allure-ai-analyzer
# or, from TestPyPI with fallback:
# pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple allure-ai-analyzer
```

3) **Provide your API key:**
Create a `.env` file in your **automation project root** (where you run the CLI) and add:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

4) **Generate a report:**
From your automation project (where `allure-results` exists):
```bash
allure-analyze generate
```

5) **View the interactive dashboard + AI analyst:**
```bash
allure-analyze view
```
By default the server binds to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or the port you pass via `--port`).

-----

## Configuration

You can override defaults by creating `allure-analyzer-config.yaml` in your **automation project root** (next to your `allure-results`).

The default settings live at `src/allure_analyzer/config/default_config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Number of top failure groups to include in the report. -1 means all groups.
top_n_groups_to_report: -1

# Include tests with 'broken' status in the analysis.
include_broken: true

# --- UI Behavior ---
# Set to true to automatically get an AI executive summary when the report loads.
proactive_summary_on_load: true
```

Most options can also be controlled via CLI flags (see below).

-----

## Usage

Once installed, the `allure-analyze` command is available in your terminal.

### 1) Generate a Report
Run from your automation project's root (where `allure-results` is located):
```bash
allure-analyze generate
```

**Useful flags:**
- `--path /path/to/results` — explicit path to `allure-results`
- `--config /path/to/config.yaml` — use a custom config
- `--top-n 10` — only report the top 10 failure groups
- `--exclude-broken` — exclude 'broken' tests from analysis

### 2) View Reports (Dashboard + AI)
```bash
allure-analyze view
```
**Useful flags:**
- `--port 8001` — run the server on a different port
- `--no-proactive-summary` — disable the automatic executive summary

### Integration with Node.js Projects
Because this is a CLI, you can wire it into `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "playwright test",
    "posttest": "allure-analyze generate",
    "report": "allure-analyze view"
  }
}
```

-----

## Troubleshooting

- **`zsh: command not found: allure-analyze`**
  - Ensure the venv is **activated** and installation succeeded: `pip show allure-ai-analyzer`.
  - On Windows PowerShell, activate via: `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.

- **`ERROR: No matching distribution found`**
  - Check Python version: `python -V` must be **3.11+**.
  - If installing from **TestPyPI**, add the fallback index:  
    `--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple`.

- **Build isolation failures like `setuptools>=40.8.0` when installing from TestPyPI**
  - Use the recommended TestPyPI install command above so dependencies come from PyPI.
  - Alternatively, preinstall critical deps: `pip install PyYAML>=6.0`.

- **Assets not found (templates/static/config)**
  - Ensure they live under `src/allure_analyzer/...` and are included via `package-data`.

-----

## Local Development

1) Clone and enter the repo:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd allure-analyzer
```

2) Create & activate a venv:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3) Install in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

4) Set your `.env` (see Quickstart), then run:
```bash
allure-analyze generate
allure-analyze view
```

-----

## Publishing (Maintainers)

> Use [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org) for dry runs and **PyPI** for production.

```bash
# Clean, build, and upload
rm -rf dist build *.egg-info
python -m pip install -U pip build twine
python -m build
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
# For PyPI production:
# python -m twine upload dist/*
```

**Common upload issues**
- *"File already exists"*: bump the version in `pyproject.toml`.
- README rendering warnings: ensure `readme = "README.md"` and Markdown is valid.

-----

## How It Works

- **Backend (Python/Flask):** The `cli.py` script serves as the entry point. It parses commands and calls the appropriate functions. The `server.py` file runs a Flask web app that serves the frontend and acts as a controller for the AI agent.

- **AI Agent:** The server manages a stateful chat session for each user. It provides the Gemini model with a "toolbox" of Python functions (e.g., `get_list_of_all_reports`, `analyze_failure_trends`). The AI autonomously decides which tools to use to gather the necessary data before formulating its answer.

- **Frontend (HTML/JS):** The `report.html` file is a single-page application. The JavaScript in `static/main.js` fetches data from the backend, renders the failure groups, draws the charts using `Chart.js`, and manages the interactive chat with the AI analyst.

-----

## Using the AI Analyst

The AI analyst understands natural language. Example prompts:

- **Simple Comparisons:**
  - "What is the difference between the last two reports?"
  - "Compare the current run to the one from `2025-09-14 21:25:20`."

- **Trend Analysis:**
  - "Analyze failure trends for the last 30 days."
  - "Is the 'Database connection timeout' failure getting better or worse over time?"
  - "What are the most persistent errors over the last week?"

- **Deep Dives:**
  - "What was the most impacted epic in the latest run?"
  - "Read the latest report and summarize the key issues for me."
  - "Are there any new, high-frequency failures that appeared in the last 3 days?"

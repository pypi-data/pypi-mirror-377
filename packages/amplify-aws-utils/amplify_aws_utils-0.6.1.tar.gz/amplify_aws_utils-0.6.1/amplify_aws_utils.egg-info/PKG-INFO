## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

amplify_aws_utils requires the following to be installed:

```text
python >= 3.8
```

### Installation

This package can be installed using `pip`

`pip install amplify_aws_utils`

### Building From Source

For development, `tox>=2.9.1` is recommended.

Python package can be built as follows:

`python setup.py sdist`

This creates a package in `dist` directory.

### Running Tests

`amplify_aws_utils` uses `tox`. You will need to install tox with `pip install tox`.
Running `tox` will automatically execute linters as well as the unit tests. You can also run them individually with
the -e argument.

For example, `tox -e lint,py38-unit` will run the linters, and then the unit tests in python 3.8

To see all the available options, run `tox -l`.

### Deployment

Deployment is done with Travis.

Package is built as described above, and is uploaded to PyPI repo using `devpi-client`

### Usage

Functions provided by this package can be imported after package has been installed.

Example:

`from amplify_aws_utils.resource_helper import throttled_call`

# aria2tui

Aria2tui is a TUI download management tool. It acts as a client for the aria2c download utility, facilitating bulk downloading, torrenting, queue control, the fine-tuning of download options (e.g., piece length, user-agent, max speed, etc.), downloading via proxy, and much more. 

Aria2tui communicates with the aria2c daemon over RPC. The UI is provided by my TUI picker [listpick](https://github.com/grimandgreedy/listpick).

## Quickstart


See [the wiki](https://github.com/grimandgreedy/aria2tui/wiki).

Install aria2tui using pip:
```bash
python -m pip install aria2tui
```

Create a `config.toml` file and place it in `~/.config/aria2tui/`. Here is the default config:

```toml
####################################################
##        Default config for Aria2TUI
##   Some common config options have been provided
##      and commented for your convenience
####################################################

[general]

port = 6800
token = "1234"
url = "http://localhost"

# Used for starting and restarting.
startupcmds = ["aria2c"]
restartcmds = ["pkill aria2c && sleep 1 && aria2c"]
# startupcmds = ["systemctl --user start aria2d.service"]
# restartcmds = ["systemctl --user restart aria2d.service", "notify-send 'Aria2c has been restarted.'"]

# Used when "Edit Config" option is chosen in the main menu
ariaconfigpath = "~/.config/aria2/aria2.conf"

# File managers 
## terminal_file_manager will open in the same terminal as Aria2TUI in a blocking fashion;
## gui_file_manager will fork a new process and open a new application.
terminal_file_manager = "yazi"
gui_file_manager = "kitty yazi"

# Launchers
## Note that the "open file(s) (grouped)" option still requires gio and xdg-mime.
launch_command = "xdg-open"
# launch_command = "termux-open"

# Data refresh time (in seconds) for the global stats and for the download data.
global_stats_timer = 1
refresh_timer = 2

# Scrolls by default
paginate = false

[appearance]
theme = 3

# Whether the right pane (DL Info, DL graphs) should be displayed by default when opening aria2tui
show_right_pane_default = false

# Which pane should be displayed first when the sidebar is opened.
# [0=DL Files (info), 1=speed graph, 2=progress graph, 3=download pieces]
right_pane_default_index = 0
```

**Note**: If you have not used aria2c before then download [this file](https://gist.github.com/qzm/a54559726896d5e6bf21adf2363ad334) and put it in ~/.config/aria2/.

After editing ~/.config/aria2tui/config.toml and ensuring that your url, port, and secret token are correct, you are all set to go:

```bash
aria2tui
```

Be aware that Aria2TUI makes use of:
 - `yazi` for selecting torrent files.
 - `nvim` for viewing/editing download options as well as adding URIs, magnet links and torrent files
 - `xdg-open` and `gio` for determining default applications and opening files.



## Tips

 - Press '?' to see the help page which will list the available keys.
 - If you have problems starting aria2c, check that you have an aria2c config file at ~/.config/aria2/aria2.conf
 - By default aria2tui will track the download that the cursor is on. This is usually what you want. However, sometimes you want to stay at a particular place in the download queue--perhaps you want to remain at the top and watch the currently active downloads.
    - Press ~ and locate the **pin cursor (pc)** option.
      - Note: The pin symbol  will be shown in the footer to indicate the cursor tracking mode.
 - If you are performing bulk operations and the downloads are changing state rapidly--e.g., hundreds of images are changing from active/waiting to completed--it is recommended to **toggle the auto-refresh** option to ensure data integrity while selecting which downloads to operate upon.
    - This can be done by either:
      - exiting to the main menu ('q') and going to "View Downloads"; or
      - Pressing ~ and toggling auto-refresh.
    - Note: The refresh symbol  at the top right indicates that you are in auto-refresh mode.

## Other installation options

### Git repo

Clone rep
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grimandgreedy/Aria2TUI

```

Install the requirements:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can start Aria2TUI:
```bash
cd ./Aria2TUI/src
python -m aria2tui.aria2tui_app
```

```bash
alias a2="cd /path/to/Aria2TUI/src && python -m aria2tui.aria2tui_app"
```

## Important

While I use Aria2TUI every day, it is still in development and there are many things that still need to be cleaned up.

Some things that should be mentioned:

 - Changing almost any download options of an active task (including the output directory) will restart the download (!!). 
   - It is recommended to add the downloads with the desired options or to specify the desired options before starting the download.
 - Aria2TUI will only work in a UNIX (linux, macos) environment. If you register your interest I might be able to look into what I would need to change to get it to work on windows.
 - Note: This was created for personal use and so some of the code is quite ugly and/or buggy and simply needs to be re-written.

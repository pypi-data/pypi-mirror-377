# autoMEA

*autoMEA* (Automated analysis of MEA datasets) is a open-source Python package for the analysis of Micro-Electrode Array (MEA) datasets. 

## How does autoMEA work?

Bursts are detected using the *Max Interval Method*. Users can manually set *Max Interval Parameters*, or can use a machine learning model that dynamically predicts optimal parameters for specific recording times. Several models are distributed with *automea*, and users are free to fine-tune the existing models for their specific needs, or upload new models completely.  

The machine-learning-based burst detection routine is explained in the paper accompanying the package. 

Tutorials and documentation can be found on [readthedocs](https://automea.readthedocs.io).


## Installation

The preferred way to install `autoMEA` is using **Conda**.

Create a new environment with Python 3.10 and activate it:

```bash
conda create -n automea_env python=3.10
conda activate automea_env
```

Install autoMEA using pip:
```bash
pip install automea
```

## Reproducibility

All the data used to train and evaluate the machine learning models distributed with autoMEA can be found on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/12685150).

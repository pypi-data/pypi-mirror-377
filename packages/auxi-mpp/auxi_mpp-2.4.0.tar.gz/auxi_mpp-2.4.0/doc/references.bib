In addition to the two model parameters that are required for each B2O3-MOx melt, where MOx is a basic oxide, three more parameters are needed when MOx is an alkali oxide to account for the formation of clusters near the tetraborate composition. The additional parameters represent the size and Gibbs energy of formation of these clusters and their contribution to the activation energy of the viscous flow. A general algorithm for the calculation of the viscosity is presented which summarizes the application of the viscosity model to melts that can contain two network formers, SiO2 and B2O3, any basic oxide and amphoteric oxides exhibiting the Charge Compensation Effect such as Al2O3. The predictive ability of the model is tested on all ternarysystems of the B2O3-Na2O-K2O-CaO-MgO-PbO-ZnO-Al2O3-SiO2 system containing both an alkali oxide and B2O3 for which experimental data are available and on several multicomponent glass-forming melts around commercial glass compositions.},

  abstract = {The simplicial homology global optimisation (SHGO) algorithm is a general purpose global optimisation algorithm based on applications of simplicial integral homology and combinatorial topology. SHGO approximates the homology groups of a complex built on a hypersurface homeomorphic to a complex on the objective function. This provides both approximations of locally convexdomains in the search space through Sperner's lemma and a useful visual tool for characterising and efficiently solving higher dimensional black and grey box optimisation problems. This complex is built up using sampling points within the feasible search space as vertices. The algorithm is specialised in finding all the local minima of an objective function with expensive function evaluations efficiently which is especially suitable to applications such as energy landscape exploration. SHGO was initially developed as an improvement on the topographical global optimisation (TGO) method. It is proven that the SHGO algorithm will always outperform TGO on function evaluations if the objective function is Lipschitz smooth. In this paper SHGO is applied to non-convex problems with linear and box constraints with bounds placed on the variables. Numerical experiments on linearly constrained test problems show that SHGO gives competitive results compared to TGO and the recently developed Lc-DISIMPL algorithm as well as the PSwarm, LGO and DIRECT-L1 algorithms. Furthermore SHGO is compared with the TGO, basinhopping (BH) and differential evolution (DE) global optimisation algorithms over a large selection of black-box problems with bounds placed on the variables from the SciPy benchmarking test suite. A Python implementation of the SHGO and TGO algorithms published under a MIT license can be found from https://bitbucket.org/upiamcompthermo/shgo/.},

In the model the viscosity is linked to the distribution of associate species as well as the connectivity of associate species. To describe the viscosity for multicomponent systems, the ternary associate species are introduced. The focus of the present paper is to describe the viscosity of the system SiO2--Al2O3--CaO--MgO--Na2O--K2O and its ternary or higher ordersystems. The model shows a good performance in describing the viscosity using only one set of model parameters, which all have a clear physico-chemical meaning. The viscosity behavior whenstituting one network modifier for another at constant SiO2 contents is well described. The Al2O3-induced viscosity maximum is also well described, in which the position and magnitude of the viscosity maximum as a function of composition and temperature (charge compensation effect) are properly predicted. Another viscosity maximum when replacing Al2O3 with SiO2 for constant contents of the network modifiers is well presented. Moreover, the current model is self-consistent, in which the extension of viscosities from lower order systems to higher order systems works well, and vice versa.},

The modified Arrhenius model, employed in this database, is a structure-based viscosity model, in which the associate species link the viscosity to the internal structure of melts. Both the temperature- and compositioninduced structural changes of melts are then described by a set of monomeric associate species in combination with the critical clusters induced by self- and inter-polymerization. The viscosity, therefore, is well described over the whole range of compositions and a broad range of temperatures by using only one set of model parameters, which have clear physico-chemical meaning. Moreover, the model is self-consistent, meaning the extension of viscosities from lower order systems to higher order systems is valid, and vice versa.},

  abstract   = {Slag viscosity as a function of temperature and composition is a very important factor in determining the operating temperature, blended coals as well as fluxing agents for slagging gasification. A number of models for predicting the viscosity of fuel slags have been developed, however, most of them are only valid in a limited range of temperatures and compositions. This study aims at developing a new viscosity model for fully liquid slag systems in the Newtonian range, based on the thermodynamic modified associate species model. The viscosity model is a structurally-based model, which gives a reliable prediction over the whole range of compositions and a broad range of temperatures. The focus of the present paper is to collect and model the experimental data for pure oxides SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O and binary systems SiO2--Al2O3, SiO2--CaO, SiO2--MgO, SiO2--Na2O, SiO2--K2O, Al2O3--CaO, Al2O3--MgO, Al2O3--Na2O, Al2O3--K2O, which is the first step to develop a new viscosity model for the system SiO2--Al2O3--CaO--MgO--Na2O--K2O. A good agreement between experimental data and calculated data has been achieved using only one set of model parameters, which have a clear physico-chemical meaning. Moreover, the extrapolated viscosities to the regions where no experimental data are available in literature are reasonable.},

The energy of pair formation may be expanded in terms of the pair fractions or in terms of the component fractions, and coordination numbers are permitted to vary with composition. The model permits complete freedom of choice to treat any ternarysystem with a symmetric or an asymmetric model. An improved general functional form for “ternary terms” in the excess Gibbs energy expression is proposed. These terms are related to the effect of a third component upon the binary pair interaction energies. It is shown how binarysystems that have been optimized with the quasi-chemical model can be combined in the same multicomponent Gibbs energy equation with binarysystems that have been optimized with a random-mixing Bragg-Williams model and a polynomial expression for the excess Gibbs energy. This is of much practical importance in the development of large databases for multicomponent solutions. The model also applies to SRO in solid solutions as a special case, when the number of lattice sites and coordination numbers are constant.},

  abstract  = {As an attempt to determine the fundamental properties of slags, and atomic structures the fractions of oxygen ions in CaO±SiO2 and CaO±AlO1:5 were measured. Samples of CaO±42:6 mol\% SiO2 \$ CaO±64:8 mol\% SiO2 and CaO±28:7 mol\% Al2O3 \$ CaO±44:7 mol\% Al2O3 were equilibrated at 1873 K and then quenched. The amount of oxygen ions of the samples was estimated by measuring areas of the Gaussian functions ®tted to the binding energy of electrons in 1s-shell of oxygen using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of these as prepared samples. The viscosity, sul®de capacities, and water solubility reported by others were analyzed with the experimental results and the ratio of activity coecients was formulated as a function of composition.

# Bezierv: A Python Package for Bézier Distributions

Bezierv provides utilities to **fit, analyze, sample, and convolve** Bézier-based
random variables from empirical data. It includes multiple fitting algorithms
(projected gradient, projected subgradient, nonlinear (Pyomo/IPOPT), and Nelder–Mead),
plus helpers for plotting and Monte Carlo convolution.

> **Tip:** See the [API reference](reference.md) for auto-generated docs from the code.

## Quickstart

Install your package (editable mode recommended while developing):

```bash
pip install bezierv
```

Fit a Bézier random variable to data with `DistFit` and sample from it:

```python
import numpy as np
from bezierv.classes.distfit import DistFit

# Synthetic bounded data
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
data = rng.beta(2, 5, 1000)  # replace with your data

fitter = DistFit(data, n=5)            # n = degree (n control segments, n+1 control points)
bz, mse = fitter.fit(method="projgrad")  # or: 'nonlinear', 'projsubgrad', 'neldermead'
print("MSE:", mse)

samples = bz.random(10_000, rng=42)     # draw samples via inverse CDF
q90 = bz.quantile(0.90)                 # 90% quantile
print("90% quantile:", q90)
```

Plot empirical vs. fitted CDF (optional):

```python
bz.plot_cdf(data)       # overlays ECDF and Bézier CDF
```

## Convolution (sum of independent Bézier RVs)

Use `Convolver` to approximate the **sum** of several fitted distributions via
Monte Carlo, then fit another Bézier RV to the result:

```python
from bezierv.classes.convolver import Convolver
from bezierv.classes.distfit import DistFit

# Fit two Bezier RVs separately (bz1, bz2) ... then:
conv = Convolver([bz, bz])          # example: sum with itself
bz_sum = conv.convolve(n_sims=1_000, rng=123, method="projgrad", n=7)
```

Plot fitted CDF (optional):

```python
bz_sum.plot_cdf(data)       # overlays ECDF and Bézier CDF
```

---

## Fitting methods at a glance

- **Projected Gradient (`projgrad`)** – fast and simple; optimizes *z* controls with projection.
- **Projected Subgradient (`projsubgrad`)** – updates both *x* and *z* with projection.
- **Nonlinear (`nonlinear`)** – solves a constrained model via Pyomo (e.g., IPOPT).
- **Nelder–Mead (`neldermead`)** – derivative-free simplex search with penalties.

## Interactive Tool
The `bezierv` package includes an interactive tool for visualizing and editing a Bézier CDF curve. This tool allows you to manipulate the curve's control points in real-time and see how the distribution's shape changes.

```python
from bezierv.classes.bezierv import InteractiveBezierv
from bokeh.plotting import curdoc

# Define the initial control points for the single curve
initial_controls_x = [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.0]
initial_controls_z = [0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 1.0]

# Create the manager instance with the initial curve
manager = InteractiveBezierv(
    controls_x=initial_controls_x,
    controls_z=initial_controls_z
)

# Add the plot layout to the document
curdoc().add_root(manager.layout)
curdoc().title = "Interactive Bézier Tool"
```

Then, run the app from your terminal using the Bokeh server:
```python
bokeh serve --show app.py
```

# LOBSTER

The **L**ightweight **O**pen **B**MW **S**oftware **T**raceability
**E**vidence **R**eport allows you to demonstrate software traceability
and requirements coverage, which is essential for meeting standards
such as ISO 26262.

This package `bmw-lobster-monolithic` is an alternative package that
installs the same things as the metapackage
[bmw-lobster](https://pypi.org/project/bmw-lobster) and additionally installs lobster-pkg. This package may
be interesting for people who wish to integrate into bazel, as
`py_wheel` cannot deal with overlapping installs.

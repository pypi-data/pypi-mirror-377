## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Installation (Recommended)**: Docker with Docker Compose for containerized deployment
- **PyPI Installation**: Python 3.11+ for direct installation from PyPI

### Installation

#### Option 1: PyPI Installation (New!)

Install Borgitory directly from PyPI:

```bash
# Install stable release from PyPI
pip install borgitory

# Or install pre-release from TestPyPI (for testing new features)
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ borgitory

# Start the server
borgitory serve

# Or run with custom settings
borgitory serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**PyPI Installation Requirements:**

- Python 3.11 or higher
- BorgBackup installed and available in PATH
- Rclone (optional, for cloud sync features)

**Note**: Pre-release versions are published to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/borgitory/) for testing before stable release.

#### Option 2: Docker Installation

1. **Pull and run the Docker image**

   ```bash
   # Using Docker directly
   docker run -d \
     -p 8000:8000 \
     -v ./data:/app/data \
     -v /path/to/backup/sources:/mnt/backup/sources:ro \
     -v /path/to/borg/repos:/mnt/repos \
     --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
     --device /dev/fuse \
     --name borgitory \
     mlapaglia/borgitory:latest
   ```

   **Or using Docker Compose** (create a `docker-compose.yml`):

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     borgitory:
       image: mlapaglia/borgitory:latest
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       volumes:
         - ./data:/app/data
         - /path/to/backup/sources:/mnt/backup/sources:ro
         - /path/to/borg/repos:/mnt/repos
       cap_add:
         - SYS_ADMIN
       devices:
         - /dev/fuse
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access the web interface**
   - Open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser
   - Create your first admin account on initial setup

**Docker Hub**: Available at [mlapaglia/borgitory](https://hub.docker.com/r/mlapaglia/borgitory)

### Docker Volumes

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data # Persistent application data (required)
  - /path/to/backup/sources:/mnt/backup/sources:ro # Source directories to backup (read-only)
  - /path/to/borg/repos:/mnt/repos # Borg repository storage (read-write)
  - /additional/source:/mnt/additional:ro # Additional source directories as needed
  - /another/repo/location:/mnt/alt-repos # Additional repository locations as needed
```

**Volume Strategy:**

- **Important**: All volumes must be mounted under `/mnt/` to be visible in the application
- Mount as many volumes as necessary to access all your backup sources and repository locations
- Source directories can be mounted read-only (`:ro`) for safety
- Repository directories need read-write access for Borg operations
- Each volume can be mapped to any convenient path under `/mnt/` inside the container
- Supports distributed setups where repositories and sources are in different locations

## Usage

### 1. Repository Setup

1. Navigate to the main dashboard
2. Add a new repository:
   - **Name**: Friendly identifier
   - **Path**: Repository location (local or remote)
   - **Passphrase**: Encryption password
3. The system will validate the repository connection

### 2. Creating Backups

**Manual Backup:**

1. Select repository from dropdown
2. Configure source path and compression
3. Click "Start Backup"
4. Monitor progress in real-time

**Scheduled Backup:**

1. Go to Schedules section
2. Create new schedule with cron expression
3. Enable/disable schedules as needed

### 3. Archive Pruning

1. Create pruning policies:
   - **Simple Strategy**: Keep archives within X days
   - **Advanced Strategy**: Granular retention (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
2. Configure options:
   - Show detailed prune lists
   - Display space savings statistics
   - Force prune execution
3. Attach policies to schedules or manual backups

### 4. Archive Browsing

**Exploring Archives:**

1. Click "View Contents" on any archive to open the browser
2. Navigate through directories by clicking folder names  
3. View file details including size and modification dates
4. Real-time directory exploration using FUSE-mounted archive filesystems

**Downloading Files:**

1. Click the download button (â¬‡) next to any file
2. Files stream directly from the mounted archive without temporary storage
3. Works efficiently with large files and slow connections
4. Multiple downloads can run simultaneously
5. Uses FUSE mounting for fast, direct file access

**Requirements:**

- Docker container must run with `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` and `--device /dev/fuse`
- Without FUSE support, archive browsing will be disabled

### 5. Cloud Sync

1. Configure S3 remote:
   - Access Key ID and Secret
2. Test connection
3. Set up automatic sync after backups or manual sync

### 6. Push Notifications

1. Configure Pushover notifications:
   - User Key and API Token
2. Choose notification triggers:
   - Success, failure, or both
3. Attach to schedules for automated alerts

## API Documentation

The application provides a RESTful API with automatic OpenAPI documentation:

- **Swagger UI**: <http://localhost:8000/docs>
- **ReDoc**: <http://localhost:8000/redoc>

## Deployment

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Production deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Manual Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t borgitory .

# Run container with FUSE support for archive browsing
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  -v /path/to/backup/sources:/mnt/backup/sources:ro \
  -v /path/to/borg/repos:/mnt/repos \
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  --device /dev/fuse \
  --name borgitory \
  borgitory
```

**Required Docker Parameters:**

- `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN`: Required for FUSE filesystem mounting to enable archive browsing
- `--device /dev/fuse`: Provides access to FUSE device for archive file system mounting

**FUSE Requirements:**

- FUSE mounting enables the interactive archive browser feature
- Allows real-time exploration of backup archives without extraction
- Supports direct file downloads from mounted archive filesystems
- Without FUSE support, archive browsing will be disabled

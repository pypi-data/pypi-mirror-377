CedarBackup3.action
===================

.. py:module:: CedarBackup3.action

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Provides interface backwards compatibility.

   In Cedar Backup 2.10.0, a refactoring effort took place to reorganize the code
   for the standard actions.  The code formerly in action.py was split into
   various other files in the CedarBackup3.actions package.  This mostly-empty
   file remains to preserve the Cedar Backup library interface.

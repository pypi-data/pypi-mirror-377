.. py:data:: logger

.. py:function:: executeStage(configPath, options, config)

   Executes the stage backup action.

   *Note:* The daily directory is derived once and then we stick with it, just
   in case a backup happens to span midnite.

   *Note:* As portions of the stage action is complete, we will write various
   indicator files so that it's obvious what actions have been completed.  Each
   peer gets a stage indicator in its collect directory, and then the master
   gets a stage indicator in its daily staging directory.  The store process
   uses the master's stage indicator to decide whether a directory is ready to
   be stored.  Currently, nothing uses the indicator at each peer, and it
   exists for reference only.

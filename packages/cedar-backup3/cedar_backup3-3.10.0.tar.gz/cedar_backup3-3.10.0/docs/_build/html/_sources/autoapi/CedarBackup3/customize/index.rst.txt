CedarBackup3.customize
======================

.. py:module:: CedarBackup3.customize

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Implements customized behavior.

   Some behaviors need to vary when packaged for certain platforms.  For instance,
   while Cedar Backup generally uses cdrecord and mkisofs, Debian ships compatible
   utilities called wodim and genisoimage. I want there to be one single place
   where Cedar Backup is patched for Debian, rather than having to maintain a
   variety of patches in different places.

.. py:function:: customizeOverrides(config, platform=PLATFORM)

   Modify command overrides based on the configured platform.

   On some platforms, we want to add command overrides to configuration.  Each
   override will only be added if the configuration does not already contain an
   override with the same name.  That way, the user still has a way to choose
   their own version of the command if they want.

   :param config: Configuration to modify
   :param platform: Platform that is in use

   Provides interface backwards compatibility.

   In Cedar Backup 2.10.0, a refactoring effort took place while adding code to
   support DVD hardware.  All of the writer functionality was moved to the
   writers/ package.  This mostly-empty file remains to preserve the Cedar Backup
   library interface.

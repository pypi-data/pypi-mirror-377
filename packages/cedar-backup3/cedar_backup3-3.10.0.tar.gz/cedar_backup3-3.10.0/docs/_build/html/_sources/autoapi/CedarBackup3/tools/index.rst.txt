   Official Cedar Backup Tools

   This package provides official Cedar Backup tools.  Tools are things that feel
   a little like extensions, but don't fit the normal mold of extensions.  For
   instance, they might not be intended to run from cron, or might need to interact
   dynamically with the user (i.e. accept user input).

   Tools are usually scripts that are run directly from the command line, just
   like the main ``cback3`` script.  Like the ``cback3`` script, the majority of a
   tool is implemented in a .py module, and then the script just invokes the
   module's ``cli()`` function.  The actual scripts for tools are distributed in
   the util/ directory.

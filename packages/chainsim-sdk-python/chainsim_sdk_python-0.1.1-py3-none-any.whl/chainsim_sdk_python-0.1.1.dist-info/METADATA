              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# cSIM SDK

A Python SDK for integrating cSIM's TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) authorization system into your applications.

## Overview

The cSIM SDK provides a simple and secure way to implement phone number verification using TOTP in your python applications. It offers a clean API for requesting and validating TOTP authorizations, with built-in TypeScript type definitions for improved development experience.

### Key Features

- TOTP-based phone number verification
- Python types support with full type definitions
- Asynchronous API
- Built-in exception handling
- aiohttp HTTP client
- Minimal dependencies

## System Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher 

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install chainsim-sdk-python
```

Or using uv:

```bash
uv add chainsim-sdk-python
```

## Configuration

To use the SDK, you'll need:
- A Provider ID from cSIM
- An API Key from cSIM

Get your own credentials - https://t.me/chainsim_partnerships;

ChainSIM demo application - https://chainsimdemo.xyz

Create a new client instance with your credentials:

```python
from chainsim_sdk import CSimClient
from chainsim_sdk.client_types import (
    CSimClientConstructor
)
from chainsim_sdk.constants import MAINNET_API_URL

main_client = CSimClient(
    params=CSimClientConstructor(
        api_url=MAINNET_API_URL,
        provider_id='your-provider-id',
        api_key='your-api-key',
    )
)
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
import asyncio

from chainsim_sdk import CSimClient
from chainsim_sdk.client_types import (
    CSimClientConstructor,
    RequestTotpAuthorizationParams,
    ValidateTotpAuthorizationParams,
)
from chainsim_sdk.constants import MAINNET_API_URL



async def main():
    # Init CSimClient client
    main_client = CSimClient(
        params=CSimClientConstructor(
            api_url=MAINNET_API_URL,
            provider_id='your-provider-id',
            api_key='your-api-key',
        )
    )

    async with main_client as client:
        # Request totp auth
        await client.request_totp_authorization(RequestTotpAuthorizationParams(
            phone_number="00000000000"
        ))

        # Validate totp auth
        # response = await client.validate_totp_authorization(ValidateTotpAuthorizationParams(
        #     phone_number="00000000000",
        #     code="000000"
        # ))
        # print(response)



if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run main function in asyncio event loop
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Advanced Usage

Handle validation results and errors:

```python
import asyncio

import chainsim_sdk.exceptions
from chainsim_sdk import CSimClient
from chainsim_sdk.client_types import (
    CSimClientConstructor,
    ValidateTotpAuthorizationParams,
)
from chainsim_sdk.constants import MAINNET_API_URL


async def main():
    main_client = CSimClient(
        params=CSimClientConstructor(
            api_url=MAINNET_API_URL,
            provider_id='your-provider-id',
            api_key='your-api-key',
        )
    )

    async with main_client as client:
        try:
            response = await client.validate_totp_authorization(ValidateTotpAuthorizationParams(
                    phone_number="00000000000",
                    code="000000"
                ))
            print(response)
        except chainsim_sdk.exceptions.BadRequestException as e:
            print(e.message)
        except chainsim_sdk.exceptions.UnauthorizedException as e:
            print('Please, authorize again')
        except chainsim_sdk.exceptions.ChainsimSDKException as e:
            print(f'Error message: {e.message}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## API Documentation

### CSimClient

#### Constructor

```python
def __init__(self, params: CSimClientConstructor) -> None:
    self._params = params
    self._session: Optional[aiohttp.ClientSession] = None
```

Configuration options:
- `provider_id` (string): Your cSIM provider ID
- `api_key` (string): Your cSIM API key
- `api_url` (string): Actual api url with slash in the end, e.g. `https://api.chainsim.io/api/v1/bridge/`

#### Methods

##### request_totp_authorization

```python
@dataclass
class RequestTotpAuthorizationParams:
    phone_number: str

async def request_totp_authorization(self, params: RequestTotpAuthorizationParams) -> None: ...
```

Parameters:
- `phone_number` (string): The phone number to verify

##### validate_totp_authorization

```python

@dataclass
class RequestTotpAuthorizationParams:
    phone_number: str

@dataclass
class ValidateTotpAuthorizationParams(RequestTotpAuthorizationParams):
    code: str

async def validate_totp_authorization(
        self,
        params: ValidateTotpAuthorizationParams
) -> ValidateTotpAuthorizationResult | None: ...
```

Parameters:
- `phone_number` (string): The phone number being verified
- `code` (string): The TOTP code received by the user

  - `number` (string): The verified phone number
  - `contract_address` (string): Associated contract address
- `user`: Object containing user details
  - `address` (string): User's address

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify your Provider ID and API Key are correct
   - Ensure you're using the latest SDK version
   - Check if your API key has the necessary permissions

2. **Invalid Phone Numbers**
   - Ensure phone numbers are in E.164 format (e.g., +1234567890)
   - Include the country code
   - Remove any special characters or spaces

3. **TOTP Validation Failures**
   - Verify the code hasn't expired
   - Ensure the code matches exactly what was received
   - Check if the phone number matches the one used in the request

4. **SSL Verification failed**
   - Could be caused by aiohttp library
   - Try: `pip install pip-system-certs`

### Error Handling

The SDK uses custom exceptions for different error scenarios:

```python
try:
    # SDK operations
except chainsim_sdk.exceptions.BadRequestException as e:
    # Handle invalid request params
except chainsim_sdk.exceptions.UnauthorizedException as e:
    # Handle authentification issues
except chainsim_sdk.exceptions.ChainsimSDKException as e:
    # Handle other cSIM-specific errors
```

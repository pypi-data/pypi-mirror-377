# Conductor for Cinema 4d

A plugin to submit render jobs to Conductor from Cinema 4D. Tested on versions R21 to 2023, Mac and Windows.

## Install

Typically, you will install the plugin from the Conductor Companion app. However, if you would like to install the plugin manually, you can do so with pip.

**To install the latest version.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade cioc4d --target=$HOME/Conductor/c4d
```

**To install a specific version, for example 0.1.0.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall cioc4d==0.1.0 --target=$HOME/Conductor/c4d
```

## Usage

Go to **Edit->Preferences->Plugins** and add the path to the cioc4d installation directory. 

```
~/Conductor/c4d/cioc4d
```

restart Cinema 4d.

To set up a render, choose **Extensions->Conductor Render**. 

For detailed help, checkout the [tutorial](https://docs.conductortech.com/tutorials/c4d) and [reference](https://docs.conductortech.com/reference/c4d) documentation.

Adds support for categorized instance types to the instance type dropdown.
Uses the latest ciocore version (6.0.0) which is greater than 5.6.0 when support for coreweave instance types was added.

### Version:0.7.10 -- 30 May 2023

* Extra renderer args are now based on the renderer selected in the Conductor UI. [15a6500]

### Version:0.7.9 -- 11 Apr 2023

* Adds support for adding extra arguments per renderer. Adds verbose logging for redshift and arnold. [af5a5bc]
* Corrects issue of non-redshift nodes being interpreted as redshift [abcf8a8]

### Version:0.6.24-- 15 Sep 2022

* Fix a bug where some non-redshift textures shared a redshift ID. If the Redshift test fails, we now try to treat it as a regular texture. [f14ed23]

### Version:0.6.17-- 28 Jun 2022

* Fixes bug where only the first use of a texture path would be made posix compliant.
* Submission success message box now links to the Conductor dashboard.

### Version:0.6.11 -- 13 Jun 2022

* Fix a bug where submission would fail because Paths were initialized with an empty path string. [047834a]

### Version:0.6.5 -- 14 Sep 2021

* When validating absolute paths on Windows, we now only issue a warning so the submission can go ahead. Sometimes C4D
  reports paths as absolute when in fact they are relative. This happens with mograph caches and
  possibly other assets. [99006b1]

### Version:0.6.4 -- 15 Aug 2021

* Implements the Make-Portable feature to localize all paths. Includes reworked validations to block
  the submission on Windows if not all paths are relative. This validation does not apply to output
  paths if the user has chosen to override the task template. [9c34828]

### Version:0.6.2 -- 12 Aug 2021

* Accommodated a C4d bug where it thinks relative assets dont exist. As such they were not uploaded. [6557166]
* Refactor and simplify the task template. It now lets c4d handle output paths by default. [6b325f8]

### Version:0.6.1 -- 30 Jul 2021

* Improved validators, with a focus on saving customers money by warning about potentially costly
  mistakes with regards to scout frames and GPU-enabled instance type selection.  [3b6c2f2]

### Version:0.6.0 -- 12 Jul 2021

### Version:0.5.3 -- 27 Jun 2021

* Update version requirements. [deb51bb]
* Fix bug in string format in response messages. [4a6641c]
* Repaired project and inst type that failed to update. [12d45d7]
* Fix missing asset validation messaging. [1b42398]

### Version:0.5.2 -- 20 Jun 2021

* Catch c4d token resolution errors so as not to disrupt workflow. [37027bc]

### Version:0.5.1 -- 20 Jun 2021

* Now depends on ciocore 3.0.0 or greater due to breaking client API changes, namely refreshable Config. [949a70d]
* Fixed a bug where the info section was not populated when the dialog first opened. [8c3992e]
* Some validations would threow an error. They are now caught and explained as best as possible in
  the validation message.  [c9df12f]
* The title, and autosave template now use native C4D dollar tokens, and have been simplified.
  Customers with existing scenes should either reset defaults or manually edit those two fields. [347a325]
* Adds missing assets validation. [9e5bd6f]

### Version:0.4.1 -- 14 Jun 2021

* Render path tokens such as $take and $camera are now resolved in the output path and in filenames
  in the task template. [c59a9ac]

### Version:0.4.0 -- 11 Jun 2021

* Add support for C4d R23 with Python 3. [4dcee59]

### Version:0.3.7 -- 27 May 2021

* Adds a validation error when redshift is selected with no GPU enabled instance_type. [fa816ec]

### Version:0.3.6 -- 11 May 2021

* Fixed an issue where the submit button enabled state was not updated even though a connection to
  Conduictor had previously been established. [2e9f2d4]

### Version:0.3.5 -- 10 May 2021

* Submission preview now stays updated when any value in render settings changes. Previously, the
  destination path, that was generated from the save-image paths, did not update when image paths
  were changed, which could cause confusion. [21b68a2]
* Validation now has better messaging with regards to relative asset paths. Specifically, we direct
  the user to the Save Project with Assets function if they are on windows and are using absolute
  drive letter paths. [0a3f51f]

* Remove recommendation to use the daemon. [838170e]

### Version:0.2.8 -- 16 Mar 2021

* Ensure the validation step always reminds the user about the upload daemon state. [8a571d6]
* Remove destination path from general section and movie it into the tasks section. The policy now is that if you want to override the task template with a custom task, then you must override the destination. Likewise, if you wan't the software to derive the task from Render Settings, then the destination will be auto generated. [9fba68c]
* Removed the preview max tasks functionality as it could cause confusion. [46cd12f]
* Remove the upload_only option, because upload only functionality is deprecated on the backend.  [de2db33]

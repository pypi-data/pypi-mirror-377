## Version:8.1.0 -- 10 Jun 2024

## Version:8.0.1 -- 22 Apr 2024

* The uploader now sends all error messages to the dashboard - not just the first error.
* Fixed a bug where --log-to-console was not not working as expected in the command line upload subcommand.
* Fixed some errors in DEBUG-level logging messages.


## Version:8.0.0 -- 07 Apr 2024

* The `conductor` commandline interface (CLI) has undergone a complete overhaul to improve its functionality and performance. It is now installed as a Python console script, which simplifies the installation process on all platforms and ensures that the tool is always accessible. In addition, this standardized installation allows for better integration into our Companion application and potentially customers' own proprietary tools.
* The commandline downloader has been rewritten to improve its performance and reliability. In previous versions, the downloader would fetch all download URLs from the server before starting any downloads. This approach was inefficient and would lead to performance issues when handling jobs with large numbers of tasks. The new downloader fetches tasks in small batches, which allows the download to start almost immediately, regardless of the number of tasks. It provides several new commandline flags, such as filtering based on filenames, and better logging, giving users more control and visibility over the download process. In addition, the new downloader has been written as an event based system that can be seamlessly integrated into other pipeline tools and GUIs. Pipeline TDs need only to register handlers to any of the events that the downloader emits.
* The `conductor` commandline now supports a new subcommand, `docs`, which opens API and commandline documentation in a local web browser. The documentation is generated using `mkdocs` and is included in the package. This command is useful as it ensures the **API** documentation is relevant to the version of the tool being used.
* The `conductor` commandline now supports a new subcommand, `packages`, which displays all available software packages on Conductor's cloud. The command can output the document as text, markdown, or nicely formatted HTML. The data is pulled from the Conductor server and is always up-to-date.
* The Python API now provides four new endpoints: `kill_tasks`, `kill_jobs`, `get_jobs`, and `get_log`.
* The Python API now provides access to entries in the Dashboard's Extra Environment Variables section. This feature allows administrators to set environment variables that are passed to all jobs run on the cloud. It's useful for setting up access to license servers or other shared resources. The API is open to clients so that they may insert account-widse variables with the correct level of precedence. 
* In addition, the environment variable schema has been extended to support a merge policy of `prepend`. This policy allows users to add new values to the beginning of the list of values for an environment variable and is useful for search paths.


## Version:7.0.2 -- 10 Nov 2023

* Bug fix: Fixed an issue where a list was copied with a Python3 only construct.
* Compatibility improvement: Tests can now be run in Python 2.7 as well.
* Cross-version support: Ensured that all tests pass successfully in both Python 2.7 and 3.9.
* Improvement: Rewrite instance type descriptions on the client. Ensure uniqueness.
* Workaround: Removed invalid 3dsmax entries from the packages response.

## Version:7.0.1 -- 30 Oct 2023

* Splits the output of the uploader. Progress now goes to stdout and logging to the system path by default.
* Corrects issue where the upload could hang in certain situations.
* Adds the provider property to HardwareSet objects so that clients can detect which cloud is enabled.
  and make adjustments based on that, such as hide the preemptible checkbox for CoreWeave instances.
* Fixes a bug in the core data class that meant the the list of platforms could be mutated out of scope.

## Version:6.3.0 -- 05 Jul 2023

* In the absence of instance-type categories provided by the endpoint, the client generates default
  categories CPU and GPU which at least splits the instance types into two groups, thereby making
  dropdown menus more manageable, especially for CoreWeave's array of machines.
* update circleci config and related documentation

## Version:6.1.0 -- 09 Jun 2023

Add the ability to specify which platforms to get resources for. This helps consumers of the API to
avoid fetching resources for Windows when the client is not ready.

## Version:6.0.0 -- 07 Jun 2023

This is a breaking change due instance types being provided as an instance of HardwareSet with
support for categories as opposed to a simple list. Consumers of the API will need to be updated to
support this change.

### Version:3.0.4 -- 17 Jul 2021

* Fixed bug where server.py global vars were not reset at start of an auth run(). This caused a
  problem when credentials were manually deleted during a single python session, which could happen
  if we suggest that course of action in a support session. [6b4132c]

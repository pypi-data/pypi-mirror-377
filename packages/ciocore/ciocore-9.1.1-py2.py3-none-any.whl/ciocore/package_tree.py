"""
A class to provide available packages as DAG structure. In reality however, the structure is just two levels deep: **hosts** and **plugins**. 

* DCCs such as **Maya** and **Cinema4D** are top-level host packages. 
* Renderers and other plugins are children of those hosts.

Methods are provided to traverse the tree to find packages by name, version, platform and so on. If you are writing submission tools there's no need to create a Package tree directly. It is recommended to use the singleton module: [ciocore.data](/data/).

The only functions you should need from this module are:

* [supported_host_names()](/package_tree/#ciocore.package_tree.PackageTree.supported_host_names)
* [supported_plugins()](/package_tree/#ciocore.package_tree.PackageTree.supported_plugins)

# Using Cognee with Python Development Data

Unite authoritative Python practice (Guido van Rossum's own contributions!), normative guidance (Zen/PEP 8), and your lived context (rules + conversations) into one *AI memory* that produces answers that are relevant, explainable, and consistent.
""",
    """
## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive tutorial, you'll discover how to transform scattered development data into an intelligent knowledge system that enhances your coding workflow. By the end, you'll have:
- Connected disparate data sources (Guido's CPython contributions, mypy development, PEP discussions, your Python projects) into a unified AI memory graph
- Built an memory layer that understands Python design philosophy, best practice coding patterns, and your preferences and experience
- Learn how to use intelligent search capabilities that combine the diverse context
- Integrated everything with your coding environment through MCP (Model Context Protocol)

This tutorial demonstrates the power of **knowledge graphs** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** for software development, showing you how to build systems that learn from Python's creator and improve your own Python development.

## Cognee and its core operations

Before we dive in, let's understand the core Cognee operations we'll be working with:
- `cognee.add()` - Ingests raw data (files, text, APIs) into the system
- `cognee.cognify()` - Processes and structures data into a knowledge graph using AI
- `cognee.search()` - Queries the knowledge graph with natural language or Cypher
- `cognee.memify()` - Cognee's \"secret sauce\" that infers implicit connections and rules from your data
""",
    """
## Data used in this tutorial

Cognee can ingest many types of sources. In this tutorial, we use a small, concrete set of files that cover different perspectives:
- `guido_contributions.json` â€” Authoritative exemplars. Real PRs and commits from Guido van Rossum (mypy, CPython). These show how Python's creator solved problems and provide concrete anchors for patterns.
- `pep_style_guide.md` â€” Norms. Encodes community style and typing conventions (PEP 8 and related). Ensures that search results and inferred rules align with widely accepted standards.
- `zen_principles.md` â€” Philosophy. The Zen of Python. Grounds design trade-offs (simplicity, explicitness, readability) beyond syntax or mechanics.
- `my_developer_rules.md` â€” Local constraints. Your house rules, conventions, and project-specific requirements (scope, privacy, Spec.md). Keeps recommendations relevant to your actual workflow.
- `copilot_conversations.json` â€” Personal history. Transcripts of real assistant conversations, including your questions, code snippets, and discussion topics. Captures "how you code" and connects it to "how Guido codes."

To strike the balanace between speed, cost, anc quality, we recommend using OpenAI's `4o-mini` model; make sure your `.env` file contains this line:

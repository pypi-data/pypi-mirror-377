Remove upper bound on packaging (#1272)

# Description

This third-party dependency had an upper bound that caused compatibility
issues with `cognite-toolkit` due to differing upper and lower bounds.
The upper bound was recently removed with this change in
`cognite-toolkit`:
https://github.com/cognitedata/toolkit/commit/2d0ef1383325e2a074e607b9fbaf06fc24a0e1de

This commit removes the upper bound in Neat as well, ensuring both
packages can now be installed in the same repo. Verified locally with an
install with `cognite-toolkit=0.6.26` and using this branch as target
for `cognite-neat`.

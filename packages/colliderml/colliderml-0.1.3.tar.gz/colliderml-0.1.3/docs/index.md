<AboutData>

The ColliderML dataset is the largest-yet source of full-detail simulation in a virtual detector experiment.

**Why virtual?** The simulation choices are not tied to a construction timeline, there are no budget limitations, no politics. The only goals are to produce the most realistic physics on a detailed detector geometry, with significant computating challenges, in an ML-friendly structure.

The ColliderML dataset provides comprehensive simulation data for machine learning applications in high-energy physics, with detailed detector responses and physics object reconstructions.

# colocal  

**Colab or local â€” same behaviour, same results.**  

`colocal` is a lightweight utility that harmonises notebook environments across **Google Colab** and **local Jupyter**.  

It takes care of paths, imports, and working directories automatically, so your notebooks behave consistently no matter where you run them.

## âœ¨ Features  

- **Seamless dual support** â†’ Detects whether youâ€™re in Colab or Jupyter and adjusts automatically.  
- **Clean imports** â†’ Adds your repository root to `sys.path`, so `import libs` always works.  
- **Consistent working directory** â†’ Sets `cwd` to the notebookâ€™s folder, avoiding `../../` hacks.  
- **Branch-aware in Colab** â†’ Parses the Colab badge, checks out the correct branch, and mirrors the repo structure.  
- **Reproducibility** â†’ Run the same notebook in Colab or locally with identical behaviour.

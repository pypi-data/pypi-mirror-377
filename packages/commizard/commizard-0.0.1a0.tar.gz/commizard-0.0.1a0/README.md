This is one of the very first times the program helped a user (me üòÑ) write a
meaningful commit message.

## üß≠ Alternatives & Similar Tools

When I started building CommiZard, I made sure to look around ‚Äî and guess what?

> CommiZard isn‚Äôt the only wizard in town! üòä

If you‚Äôre exploring AI-powered commit tools, here are some other great projects
worth checking out:

- **[easycommit](https://github.com/blackironj/easycommit)** ‚Äî written in Go,
  supports Ollama models out of the box.
- **[aicommit](https://github.com/suenot/aicommit)** ‚Äî Packed with features ‚Äî
  including a handy VS Code extension.
- **[AICommit2](https://github.com/tak-bro/aicommit2)** ‚Äî The most complete FOSS
  option I've found

> *Why did I still follow through and build this?*
>
> Because I couldn‚Äôt find a tool that gave me both full user control and the
> little UX comforts I wanted.
>
> So yeah ‚Äî I built CommiZard for me‚Ä¶ and maybe for you too üòâ

> [!WARNING]
>
> ⚠️ **Heads up!** CommiZard is in **early alpha**. Not all features are
> complete or stable yet.
>
> CommiZard is under active development — expect bugs, crashes, and missing
> functionality.
> Please [open an issue](https://github.com/Chungzter/CommiZard/issues) if you
> encounter problems.
>
> Many features are still missing, since this project was released as a Minimum
> Viable Product (MVP). Stay tuned for new improvements!

## Usage

After installing CommiZard (See [Installation](#-installation)), you can launch
the interactive REPL in your Git repository:

```bash
commizard
```

Once launched, you’ll enter the interactive CommiZard terminal, where you can
use the following commands:

### Commands

|     Command      |                         Description                          |
|:----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|

|      `gen`       | Generate a new commit message based on the current Git diff. |
|       `cp`       |         Copy the generated output to your clipboard          |
|     `commit`     |             Directly commit the generated output             |

### Example Usage

This is one of the very first times the program helped a user (me 😄) write a
meaningful commit message.

## 🧭 Alternatives & Similar Tools

When I started building CommiZard, I made sure to look around — and guess what?

> CommiZard isn’t the only wizard in town! 😊

If you’re exploring AI-powered commit tools, here are some other great projects
worth checking out:

- **[easycommit](https://github.com/blackironj/easycommit)** — written in Go,
  supports Ollama models out of the box.
- **[aicommit](https://github.com/suenot/aicommit)** — Packed with features —
  including a handy VS Code extension.
- **[AICommit2](https://github.com/tak-bro/aicommit2)** — The most complete FOSS
  option I've found

> *Why did I still follow through and build this?*
>
> Because I couldn’t find a tool that gave me both full user control and the
> little UX comforts I wanted.
>
> So yeah — I built CommiZard for me… and maybe for you too 😉

..
   [ ]  how to learn about condor
   [x] parallel_processing - quick guide on parallel processing
   [ ] external_solver

   [ ] optimization_callback
   [ ]     from_values - or part of callback?
   [ ] pareto_front - using a constraint to sweep?

   [ ] external solver

   [ ] variable -- warmstart, initializer, etc.
   [ ] set_initial - set initial for iterative solvers

   [ ] options (or to topic) -- inspect implementation, basic usage and philosophy? so actually topic
   [ ] how to access model metadata

   [ ] how to dry-up 
   [ ] alias_dict - use dictionaries for manging IO
   [ ] functions operating on fields

   [ ] model_generators - not sure what this was for? maybe just a header for the two below??
   [ ] functional_class_factory - using metaprogramming machinery in a function
   [ ] configuration_class_factory - using configuration to make a dynamic model
   [ ]    dynamic link?




   [ ] new_model_template -- 
   [ ]   extend existing model with pre-populated fields/using placeholders
   [ ]   Defining fields/creating new fields
   [ ]   Creating a new implementaiton vs using existing
   [ ]   custom metaclass for construction/model behaviors
   [ ]   staticmethod vs classmethod vs (instance)method --  or is this in topics



   [ ] new_solver -- create new implementation to re-route ?? :(

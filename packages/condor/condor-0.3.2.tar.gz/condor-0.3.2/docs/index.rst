Documentation
----------------------------------

The documentation is organized as follows:

* :doc:`Tutorials </tutorial/index>` have several small examples that show you the basics of translating a mathematical model into condor code, evaluating the model, and using it other scientific python tools. Start here if you're new to condor.

* :doc:`Topic guides <topics/index>` discuss key topics and concepts at a
  fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

* :doc:`API docs </api/index>` contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Condor's machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

* :doc:`How-to guides </howto/index>` are recipes. They guide you through the
  steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more
  advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Condor works.

* :doc:`Examples </examples/index>` provide demonstrations with fewer annotations, as
  a reference for users and test of functionality in CI.

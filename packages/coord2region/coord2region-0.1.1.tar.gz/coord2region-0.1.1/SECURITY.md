## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Coord2Region seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing hamza.abdelhedii@gmail.com. Do **not** open a public issue for security-related matters.

We will acknowledge your report within a reasonable time frame and work with you to address the issue promptly. Once the vulnerability is resolved we will disclose it publicly with credit to the reporter, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

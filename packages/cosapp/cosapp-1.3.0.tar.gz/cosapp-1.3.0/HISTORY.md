# History


## 1.3.0 (2025-09-18)

### New features & API changes

- Deprecation of methods `NonLinearSolver.extend` and `RunSingleCase.extend`, replaced by new methods `add_problem` (MR [#430](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/430)).
- Declaring integer-valued `numpy` arrays no longer raises a warning (MR [#428](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/428)).
- Harmonize solver option "history" between `NonLinearSolver` and `Optimizer` (MR [#432](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/432)).
  `Optimizer` option "monitored" is now deprecated, in favour of "history".
  Moreover, option "history" can now be set at recorder creation:

  ```python
  solver = system.add_solver(NonLinearSolver("solver"))

  solver.add_recorder(DataFrameRecorder(...), history=True)
  ```

## 1.0.0 (2025-03-12)

### New feature: Parallel execution of drivers

The parallelization of certain drivers was implemented by [Adrien Delsalle](https://gitlab.com/adriendelsalle) and [Ga√©tan Laurens](https://gitlab.com/GtnLrs) (MRs [#330](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/330), [#332](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/332), [#334](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/334), [#335](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/335), [#339](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/339), [#341](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/341), [#345](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/345), [#348](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/348), [#353](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/353), [#357](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/357), [#365](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/365), [#374](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/374), [#390](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/390)):
- `LinearDoE` and `MonteCarlo`;
- `NonLinearSolver` (computation of the Jacobian matrix in parallel).

This major feature relies on a robust serialization of systems, drivers and recorders, using either `pickle` or `json`.
The serialization of all drivers, in particular, allows for the parallel execution of the drivers listed above, even when they contain sub-drivers.

#### Example

In the example below, using the `Ballistics` system from the advanced time driver tutorial, we compute the initial velocity leading to a targetted end point, after an imposed flight time of two seconds.
This design case implies a `RungeKutta` time driver, embedded into a `NonLinearSolver` driver.
For the latter, we request a parallel computation of the Jacobian matrix by forward finite differences, using three workers.

```python
from cosapp.drivers import NonLinearSolver, RungeKutta
from cosapp.core.numerics.solve import FfdJacobianEvaluation
from cosapp.utils.execution import ExecutionPolicy, ExecutionType

# Set test case
point = Ballistics("point")
ncpus = 3  # compute the Jacobian matrix using 3 workers

solver = point.add_driver(
    NonLinearSolver(
        "solver",
        jac=FfdJacobianEvaluation(
            execution_policy=ExecutionPolicy(ncpus, ExecutionType.MULTI_PROCESSING)
        ),
    )
)
driver = solver.add_child(RungeKutta(time_interval=(0, 2), dt=0.1, order=3))

# Set design problem: compute initial velocity that leads to a target point
solver.add_unknown("v0").add_equation("x == [10, 0, 0]")

# Define a time simulation scenario
driver.set_scenario(
    init={"x": [0, 0, 0], "v": "v0"},
    values={"point.mass": 1.5, "point.k": 0.9},
)

# Set initial guess & solve
point.v0 = np.ones(3)
point.run_drivers()
```

### Other new features & API changes

- Implementation of second-order, implicit time driver `CrankNicolson` (MRs [#377](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/377)).
  This driver essentially works like a nonlinear solver, solving for both transient variables and intrinsic unknowns of the system of interest.
  Therefore, it is highly recommended for dynamic systems containing algebraic loops or intrinsic constraints, instead of nesting a nonlinear solver inside an explicit time driver.
- Detect the occurrence of multiple primary events at the same time (MR [#376](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/376)).
- Add the possibility to filter events with a Boolean expression evaluated in a specific context, other than that of the event owner (MR [#375](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/375)).
- Add `numpy.where` and `logspace` to the scope of evaluable expressions, used in equations and boundary conditions, *e.g.* (MR [#382](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/382)).

### Bug fixes and code improvements

- Bug fix in `EvalString` serialization (MR [#383](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/383)).
- Bug fix in the serialization of events (MR [#386](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/386)).
- Bug fix in `MonteCarlo` with a time subdriver (MRs [#378](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/378), [#392](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/392)).
- Prevent name clashes for ports and sub-systems (MR [#381](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/381)).
- Other bug fixes (MRs [#379](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/379), [#380](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/380), [#389](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/389)).

- Compatibility with `pytest` 8.3 was restored (MR [#388](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/388)).
- The code is no longer compatible with Python 3.8, as it now contains type hints of the kind `list[str]` or `dict[str, float]` (instead of `typing.List` and `typing.Dict`), introduced in Python 3.9.

  In particular, this version introduces the possiblity to declare as unknown any settable attribute of an input object (that is an object contained in an input port), which until now was only possible for input port variables.
  Example:

  ```python
  from cosapp.base import System
  from cosapp.drivers import NonLinearSolver
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  @dataclass
  class Foo:
    a: float
    x: float

  class SomeSystem(System):
      def setup(self):
          self.add_inward("foo", Foo(a=1.0, x=1.0))
          self.add_outward("y", 0.0)

      def compute(self):
          self.y = self.foo.a - self.foo.x**3
  
  system = SomeSystem("system")
  solver = system.add_driver(NonLinearSolver("solver"))

  solver.add_unknown("foo.x")   # attribute `x` can now be manipulated by the solver
  solver.add_equation("y == 0")

  system.foo.a = -2.0
  system.run_drivers()

  import pytest, math
  assert system.foo.x == pytest.approx(math.cbrt(system.foo.a))
  ```

- Fix bug in `TwoPointCubicInterpolator` with multidimensional arrays (MR [#355](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/355)).
- Allow filtered events in merged events (MR [#356](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/356)):

  ```python
  system.event.trigger = Event.merge(
      event_a,
      event_b.filter("x > 0"),
  )
  ```

- Introduction of periodic events (MR [#360](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/360)):

  ```python
  from cosapp.multimode import PeriodicTrigger

  system.event_a.trigger = PeriodicTrigger(period=2.3)
  system.event_b.trigger = PeriodicTrigger(period=0.25, t0=0.33)
  ```

  class SomeSystem(System):
      def setup(self):
          foo = self.add_child(Foo('foo'), pulling=['a', 'b', {'c': 'c_foo'}])

- Optional argument `execution_index` in `System.add_child` and `Driver.add_child` can now take a negative value, with a behaviour following that of `list.insert` (MR [#250](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/250)).

### Bug fixes and code quality

- Add missing field "time" in `ExplicitTimeRecorder.event_data`, when no recorder is set (MR [#245](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/245)).
- Fix bug with recorders inspecting systems with iterators (MRs [#246](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/246) and [#247](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/247)).
- Fix bug with `NonLinearSolver` with NumPy array residues (MR [#248](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/248)).
- Fix initialization bug of targets involving expressions (MR [#249](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/249)).


## 0.15.0 (2023-07-20)

### New features & API changes

- Suppression of default `RunSingleCase` subdriver `runner` in `NonLinearSolver` drivers (MR [#239](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/239)).
- Enable target initialization in multi-point design problems (MR [#233](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/233)).
- New utility function `swap_system` to replace on the fly a subsystem by another `System` instance (MR [#238](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/238)).

### Bug fixes and code quality

- Refactor driver `Optimizer` (MR [#240](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/240)).
- Various bug fixes (MRs [#234](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/234), [#235](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/235), [#241](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/241)).

### Documentation

- New tutorial on `swap_system` (MR [#243](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/243)).
- General update of tutorials (MRs [#232](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/232) and [#242](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/242)).


## 0.14.1 (2023-06-08)

### Bug fixes and code quality

- Fix incorrect output file name in `cosapp.tools.parse_module` (MR [#229](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/229)).
- Refactoring pass (MR [#230](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/230)).

### Documentation

- Upgrade documentation build stack (MRs [#224](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/224) and [#226](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/226)).
- Fix bad rendering of ports and systems (MRs [#227](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/227) and [#228](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/228)).


## 0.14.0 (2023-05-17)

### New features & API changes

* Improved performance, through a revised clean/dirty mechanism (MR [#215](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/215)).
* Possibility to add a contextual description to sub-systems and ports of a system, as well as sub-drivers (MR [#216](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/216)). This feature is useful for automatic documentation tools, and has been included in the Markdown representation of systems (also used in function `cosapp.tools.display_doc`). Example:
  
  ```python
  from cosapp.base import System
  from my_module import FlowPort
  
  class MySystem(System):
      def setup(self):
          self.add_input(FlowPort, "fl_in1", desc="Primary inlet flow port")
          self.add_input(FlowPort, "fl_in2", desc="Secondary inlet flow port")
  
          self.add_output(FlowPort, "fl_out")
  ```
  
* New hook function `_parse_module_config`, returning pre-defined settings for `cosapp.tools.parse_module` (MR [#218](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/218)). This allows module maintainers to simply call
  
  ```python
  from cosapp.tools import parse_module
  import my_module
  
  parse_module(my_module)
  ```

  instead of, *e.g.*,

  ```python
  parse_module(
      my_module,
      ctor_config={
          "ComplexSystem1": [
              dict(n=1, foo=0.5),
              dict(n=2, foo=0.1),
          ],
          "ComplexSystem2": [
              dict(xi=0.0, __alias__="ComplexSystem2_a"),
              dict(xi=1.0, __alias__="ComplexSystem2_b"),
          ],
      },
      excludes=["Foo*", "*Bar?"],
  )
  ```

  provided `my_module._parse_module_config()` returns a dictionary specifying the values of `ctor_config`, `excludes`, *etc.*

* Make `SolverResults` a `dataclass`, for easier handling of `NonLinearSolver.results`, *e.g.* (MR [#220](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/220)).
* Expose attribute `problem` in system setup (MR [#221](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/221)). Previously, `problem` was only exposed in method `System.transition`.

### Bug fixes and code quality

* Fix bug in `NonLinearSolver` log message (MR [#214](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/214)).
* Add missing JSON file in PyPI and conda packages, preventing the use of `cosapp.tools.parse_module` (MR [#219](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/219)).

### Documentation

* Illustrate port and sub-system description in tutorials (MR [#215](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/215)).


## 0.13.1 (2023-04-03)

### Bug fixes and code quality

* Update test baseline to pass in a Python 3.11 environment (MR [#200](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/200)).
* Creation of a dummy system factory, mostly for tests (MR [#201](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/201)).
* Improve clean/dirty mechanism (MR [#202](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/202)) and fix incorrect clean/dirty status with surrogate models (MR [#205](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/205)).
* Fix bug in function `cosapp.tools.display_doc` for classes with setup arguments (MR [#208](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/208)).
* Various code quality improvements (MRs [#211](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/211), [#212](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/212)).

### Documentation

Note: extensive use of self-documenting f-strings (introduced in Python 3.8) has made tutorials incompatible with Python 3.7.

* Updated tutorials (MRs [#203](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/203), [#206](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/206), [#207](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/207), [#210](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/210)).
* The image used in binder is now based on Python 3.10 (MR [#204](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/204)).

### Module parser

* New function `parse_module` in `cosapp.tools` collecting all system and port classes within a Python module. This parser, generating a JSON file containing the description of all CoSApp symbols, is primarily meant to be used for constructional GUI applications, developed separately (MRs [#192](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/192) & [#209](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/209)).


## 0.13.0 (2023-02-09)

### Python 3.10 support

The code is now tested for Python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.
Support of Python 3.7 is thus officially dropped, although no version-specific Python code was introduced in this version of CoSApp.

### New features & API changes

* Module `connectors` moved from `cosapp.core` to `cosapp.ports` (MR [#189](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/189)).
* New "direct" (with no unit conversion) connector classes `PlainConnector`, `CopyConnector` and `DeepCopyConnector`, in `cosapp.ports.connectors` (MR [#188](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/188)).
* New method `MathematicalProblem.is_empty()`, equivalent to `shape == (0, 0)` (MR [#186](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/186)).
* Improved VisJs graph rendering, by limiting node size for long system names (MR [#184](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/184)).
* New utility functions `get_state` and `set_state` in `cosapp.utils`, for quick system data recovery (MR [#193](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/193)):

  ```python
  from cosapp.utils import get_state, set_state
  
  s = SomeSystem('s')
  # ... many design steps, say
  
  # Save state in local object
  designed = get_state(s)
  
  s.drivers.clear()
  s.add_driver(SomeDriver('driver'))
  
  try:
      s.run_drivers()
  except:
      # Recover previous state
      set_state(s, designed)
  ```

* Functions `radians`, `degrees` and `arctan2`/`atan2` have been added to the scope of `EvalString` objects, and can therefore be used in equations, *e.g.* (MR [#178](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/178)).
* Recorders can now record constant properties (MR [#181](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/181)).
* Deprecation of `System.get_unsolved_problem` in favour of new method `assembled_problem` (MR [#174](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/174)).
* Inner off-design problem of systems is now exposed as attribute `problem`, but only within the `transition` method (MR [#174](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/174)). This allows users to add or remove off-design constraints during event-driven transitions, while keeping this property inaccessible the rest of the time.

  ```python
  from cosapp.base import System
  from math import sin, cos
  
  class SomeSystem(System):
      def setup(self):
          self.add_inward('x', 0.0)
          self.add_inward('y', 0.0)
          self.add_outward('z', 0.0)
          a = self.add_event('event_a', trigger='x > y')
          b = self.add_event('event_b', trigger='x < y')
      
      def compute(self):
          self.z = cos(self.x) * sin(self.y)
  
      def transition(self):
          offdesign = self.problem
          if self.event_a.present:
              offdesign.clear()
              offdesign.add_equation('z == 0.5').add_unknown('x')
          if self.event_b.present:
              offdesign.clear()
  ```

### Bug fixes and code quality

* Fix serialization bugs for systems with setup parameters (MR [#180](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/180)) and `None` variables (MR [#172](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/172)).
* Bug fix on event time calculation involving array transients (MR [#177](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/177)).

* Updated Tips & Tricks (MR [#196](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/196)).
* Other updates (MRs [#176](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/176), [#195](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/195), [#198](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/198)).

## 0.12.3 (2022-09-21)

### New features & API changes

* Improved user experience:
  * Auto-completion for dynamically added attributes of systems (ports, subsystems, inwards, outwards, events...) and drivers (sub-drivers) (MRs [#164](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/164) and [#166](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/166));
  * Improved representation of mathematical problems, in particular for loop equations and multi-point design problems (MRs [#159](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/159), [#160](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/160) and [#163](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/163)).
* New method `System.new_problem` to facilitate the creation of dynamic design methods, *e.g.* (MR [#162](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/162)).

### Documentation

* `Optimizer.set_objective` is deprecated, in favour of `set_minimum` and `set_maximum` (MR [#150](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/150)).
* Loop residues are no longer normalized (MR [#151](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/151)).
* Improved type hints for ports, systems and drivers, in functions whose return type depends on arguments, such as `System.add_child`, `add_driver`, *etc.* (MR [#145](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/145)).

### Documentation

* Updated tutorials (MRs [#144](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/144), [#147](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/147) and [#154](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/154)).

* Fix bug on event initialization (MR [#146](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/146)).
* Fix bad markdown formatting of ports occurring in `jupyterlab` 3.4 (MR [#149](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/149)).
* Fix failed test caused by a regression in `pytest` 7.1 (MR [#142](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/142)).

## 0.12.1 (2022-02-25)

### New features & API changes

* Simplification of driver `Optimizer`:
  * Suppression of sub-driver `runner` (MR [#136](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/136)). This change introduces new methods `set_objective`, `add_unknowns` and `add_constraints` in driver `Optimizer`.
  * Optimization constraints are now declared with human-readable expressions in `Optimizer.add_constraints` (MR [#138](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/138)).

  Before:
    
  ```python
  from cosapp.drivers import Optimizer
  
  s = SomeSystem('s')
  optim = s.add_driver(Optimizer('optim'))
  
  optim.runner.set_objective('cost')
  optim.runner.add_unknown(['a', 'b', 'p_in.x'])
  # Enter constraints as non-negative expressions:
  optim.runner.add_constraints([
      "b - a",  # b >= a
      "a",      # a >= 0
      "1 - a",  # a <= 1
  ])
  optim.runner.add_constraints(
      "p_out.y",
      inequality = False,  # p_out.y == 0
  )
  
  s.run_drivers()
  ```
  
  After:
    
  ```python
  optim.set_objective('cost')
  optim.add_unknown(['a', 'b', 'p_in.x'])
  optim.add_constraints(
      "b >= a",
      "0 <= a <= 1",
      "p_out.y == 0",
  )
  ```

  * New, convenient iterators and setters for ports (MR [#137](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/137)):
  
  ```python
  from cosapp.base import Port, System
  
  class XyzPort(Port):
      def setup(self):
          self.add_variable('x')
          self.add_variable('y')
          self.add_variable('z')
  
  class SomeSystem(System):
      def setup(self):
          self.add_input(XyzPort, 'p_in')
          self.add_output(XyzPort, 'p_out')
      
      def compute(self):
          self.p_out.set_from(self.p_in)  # assign values from `p_in`
          self.p_out.z = 0.0
  
  s = SomeSystem('s')
  # Multi-variable setter `set_values`
  s.p_in.set_values(x=1, y=-0.5, z=0.1)
  
  s.run_once()
  # Dict-like (key, value) iterator `items`:
  for varname, value in s.p_out.items():
      print(f"p_out.{varname} = {value})
  ```

### Documentation

* Updated tutorials on ports (MR [#139](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/139)) and on optimization (MR [#140](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/140)).

### Bug fixes and code quality

## 0.12.0 (2022-01-17)

### New features

* Implementation of multimode systems and hybrid continuous/discrete time solver (MRs [#100](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/100), [#103](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/103), [#105](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/105)-[#108](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/108), [#110](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/110)-[#121](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/121)):

* Updated build config file following up a bug fix in [github.com/readthedocs](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org) (MR [#109](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/109)).

## 0.11.8 (2021-11-24)

### New features & API evolutions

* New module `cosapp.base` (MR [#96](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/96)) containing base classes for user-defined classes (in particular, `Port`, `System` and `Driver`). Also contains `BaseConnector`, base class for custom connectors (see "User-defined and peer-to-peer connectors" below), as well as CoSApp-specific exceptions `ScopeError`, `UnitError` and `ConnectorError`.
**Note:** `Port`, `System` and `Driver` can still be imported from `cosapp.ports`, `cosapp.systems` and `cosapp.drivers`, respectively.

* Public API `cosapp.base.SurrogateModel` to define custom surrogate models used in `System.make_surrogate` (MR [#97](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/97)).
Pre-defined models have been moved to module `cosapp.utils.surrogate_models`.

* System-to-system connections (MR [#94](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/94)).

```python
class LegacyPortToPort(System):
    def setup(self):
        a = self.add_child(ModelA('a'))
        b = self.add_child(ModelB('b'))

        # Explicit port-to-port connections
        self.connect(a.p_in, b.p_out)
        self.connect(a.outwards, b.inwards, {'y': 'x'})

class Alternative(System):
  """Same as `LegacyPortToPort`, with alternative connection syntax"""
    def setup(self):
        a = self.add_child(ModelA('a'))
        b = self.add_child(ModelB('b'))

        # Alternative syntax: connect systems, with port or variable mapping
        self.connect(a, b, {'p_in': 'p_out', 'y': 'x'})
```

* User-defined and peer-to-peer connectors (MR [#87](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/87) and MR [#98](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/98)).

```python
import numpy
from copy import deepcopy
from cosapp.base import Port, System, BaseConnector

class DeepCopyConnector(BaseConnector):
  """User-defined deep-copy connector"""
    def transfer(self) -> None:
        source, sink = self.source, self.sink

        for target, origin in self.mapping.items():
            value = getattr(source, origin)
            setattr(sink, target, deepcopy(value))

class CustomPort(Port):
    def setup(self):
        self.add_variable('x', 0.0)
        self.add_variable('y', 1.0)

    class Connector(BaseConnector):
      """Connector for peer-to-peer connections"""
        def transfer(self) -> None:
            source, sink = self.source, self.sink
            sink.x = source.y
            sink.y = -source.x

class MyModel(System):
    def setup(self):
        self.add_input(CustomPort, 'p_in')
        self.add_output(CustomPort, 'p_out')

# Add design points:
takeoff = solver.add_child(RunSingleCase('takeoff'))
cruise = solver.add_child(RunSingleCase('cruise'))

# Unknowns defined at solver level regarded as *design* unknowns
solver.add_unknown(['fan.diameter', 'core.turbine.inlet.area'])

## 0.11.5 (2021-05-07)

### New features

* **New [binder container](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/cosapp%2Fcosapp/master?urlpath=lab/tree/docs/tutorials)**,
  allowing anyone to run interactively the tutorials used in the online documentation 
  (MR [#30](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/30) and [#36](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/36)).

* **Deferred equations to set targets:**

  New method `add_target`, defining a deferred equation on on a target variable (MR [#48](https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp/-/merge_requests/48)).
  In effect, `add_target` creates an equation whose right-hand side is evaluated dynamically prior to each execution of the nonlienar solver.

  In the example below, the feature is illustrated in design mode. Outward `z` is a function of two independent variables `x` and `y`.
  When design method `'target_z'` is activated, the actual value of `z`, set interactively, is used as a target value, with unknown `y`:
  
```python
class SystemWithTarget(System):
    def setup(self):
        self.add_inward('x', 1.0)
        self.add_inward('y', 1.0)
        self.add_outward('z', 1.0)

        # Define design problem with a target on `z`
        design = self.add_design_method('target_z')
        design.add_unknown('y').add_target('z')

    def compute(self):
        self.z = self.x * self.y**2

s = SystemWithTarget('s')

solver = s.add_driver(NonLinearSolver('solver', tol=1e-9))
# Activate design method 'target_z': outward `z` becomes a target
solver.runner.design.extend(s.design_methods['target_z'])

s.x = 0.5
s.y = 0.5
s.z = 2.0  # set target
s.run_drivers()
assert s.y == pytest.approx(2)  # solution of x * y**2 == 2
assert s.z == pytest.approx(2)

s.z = 4.0  # dynamically set new target
s.run_drivers()
assert s.y == pytest.approx(np.sqrt(8))  # solution of x * y**2 == 4
assert s.z == pytest.approx(4)
```
  Targets can be also be declared in off-design mode, by calling `self.add_target(...)` in `System.setup`.

```python
plane = Aeroplane('plane')  # system with subsystems engine1 and engine2

# Say engine systems have one input parameter `fuel_rate`
# and possibly several outputs, and many sub-systems

# Create training schedule for input data
doe = pandas.DataFrame(
    # loads of input data
    columns=['fuel_rate', 'fan.diameter', ..]  # input names
)
plane.engine1.make_surrogate(doe)  # generates output data and train model

plane.run_once()  # executes the surrogate model of `engine1` instead of original compute()

# dump model to file
plane.engine1.dump_surrogate('engine.bin')
# load model into `engine2`:
plane.engine2.load_surrogate('engine.bin')

# deactivate surrogate model on demand
plane.engine1.active_surrogate = plane.engine2.active_surrogate = False

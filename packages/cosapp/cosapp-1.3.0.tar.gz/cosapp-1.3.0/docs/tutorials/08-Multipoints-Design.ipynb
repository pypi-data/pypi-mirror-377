    "# Multi-point design\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, systems have been solved in their up-and-running state, that is all inputs are set, and we want to obtain the state of the system for a given set of boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As CoSApp focuses on system design, we will now show how one can free parameters and compute them to satisfy design equations.\n",
    "In complex systems, parameters are designed under most critical constraints, which usually occur in different operating conditions.\n",
    "As will be illustrated here, CoSApp is able to solve such multi-point design calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-point design is based on the interaction between a `NonLinearSolver` driver, and several `RunSingleCase` sub-drivers (one per design point).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = Turbofan(\"engine\")\n",
    "\n",
    "solver = engine.add_driver(NonLinearSolver(\"solver\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add design points:\n",
    "takeoff = solver.add_child(RunSingleCase(\"takeoff\"))\n",
    "cruise = solver.add_child(RunSingleCase(\"cruise\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `RunSingleCase` driver will contain\n",
    "\n",
    "* Operating conditions;\n",
    "* Design unknowns and equations to be satisfied;\n",
    "* Other nonlinear conditions which may be satisfied at design point only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating conditions are specified by a dictionary of the kind `{variable_name: value}`, using method `set_values`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cruise.set_values({\n",
    "    \"altitude\": 3000,\n",
    "    \"rho\": \"1.21 * exp(-altitude / 8e3)\",\n",
    "    # and so on\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "Additional values may be later appended, with method `add_values`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design and off-design problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Design parameters refer to variables whose value is independent of operating conditions.\n",
    "Geometric parameters, typically, can be used as design parameters.\n",
    "Design unknowns are unique, and will all be computed jointly by the solver.\n",
    "Therefore, by convention, all unknowns declared at solver level will be regarded as design parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine we seek to determine two geometric parameters of our turbofan engine, in order to meet conditions at take-off and cruise.\n",
    "This problem is simply declared by:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "solver.add_unknown([\"fan.diameter\", \"core.turbine.inlet.area\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "takeoff.add_equation(\"thrust == 1.2e5\")\n",
    "cruise.add_equation(\"Mach == 0.8\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the fan diameter and turbine inlet area used in system-wide computations will be common to both take-off and cruise design points.\n",
    "The constraint on thrust, though, will be satisfied at take-off only, whereas the Mach number target will be met in cruise conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, specific design parameters are often associated to operating criteria.\n",
    "Thus, for convenience, design unknowns can be associated to design equations at design point level, using attribute `design` of `RunSingleCase` drivers.\n",
    "The code below generates a multi-point design problem equivalent to previous snippet:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "takeoff.design.add_unknown(\"core.turbine.inlet.area\").add_equation(\"thrust == 1e4\")\n",
    "\n",
    "cruise.design.add_unknown(\"fan.diameter\").add_equation(\"Mach == 0.8\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Oppositely, *off-design* unknowns may be declared several times, in various operating conditions.\n",
    "However, they can (and usually do) converge towards different values at different points.\n",
    "Thus, a local clone of each off-design unknown is created in each design point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Off-design conditions can be specified at operating point level, using the `offdesign` problem attribute, instead of `design`.\n",
    "For the sake of convenience and conciseness, though, `offdesign` may be omitted.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "takeoff.add_unknown(\"fuel_flowrate\").add_equation(\"core.burner.flow_out.T == 1500\")\n",
    "\n",
    "cruise.add_unknown(\"fuel_flowrate\").add_equation(\"core.burner.c_nox == 1e-2\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "will determine the fuel flowrate at take-off corresponding to a target temperature at combustor outlet; fuel consumption in cruise conditions will be computed to satisfy a criterion on NOx concentration.\n",
    "The value assumed in other points (if any) may also be set independently, using `set_values`, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "* For a `RunSingleCase` design point *case*, `case.add_unknown(...)` (respectively `add_equation`, `extend`) is a shortcut to `case.offdesign.add_unknown(...)`.\n",
    "* Fixing a parameter using `case.set_values({\"x\": \"0.123\"})` is mathematically equivalent to the trivial constaint `case.add_unknown(\"x\").add_equation(\"x == 0.123\")`. Thus, the local off-design problem can be viewed as an extension of `set_values` for non-trivial, nonlinear constraints.\n",
    "* In single-point design, solver and case problems (either off-design or design) are interchangeable. However, it is good practice to follow multi-point design rules, for the sake of consistency.\n",
    "* Equations declared at solver level are satisfied independently on each `RunSingleCase` subdriver. Thus, in multi-point problems, be aware that a single solver equation will eventually result in several equations in the assembled mathematical problem."

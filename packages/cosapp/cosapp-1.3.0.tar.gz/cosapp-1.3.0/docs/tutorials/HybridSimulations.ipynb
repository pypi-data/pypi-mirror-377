    "## Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Events are triggerable objects which activate when a certain condition is detected in their owner system.\n",
    "They are defined at system setup with method `add_event`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BasicEventSystem(System):\n",
    "    def setup(self):\n",
    "        self.add_event('e')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this basic example, event `e` is defined, but no activation condition is prescribed.\n",
    "As long as it is the case, the event will never occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation of an event is driven by its attribute `trigger`.\n",
    "In the most simple case, the trigger is defined by a character string describing the activation condition as an evaluable expression.\n",
    "An event trigger can be set at the definition of the event, by specifying argument `trigger=...` in `add_event`, or interactively for a given system, as in:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "basic = BasicEventSystem('basic')\n",
    "\n",
    "basic.e.trigger = 't == 0.123'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, system `basic` will react if time ever reaches value 0.123 during a time simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid trigger expressions are of the kind `\"lhs <op> rhs\"`, where left- and right-hand sides `lhs` and `rhs` are expressions evaluable in the context of the owner system, and operator `<op>` is one of (`==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).\n",
    "Even though `\"lhs <op> rhs\"` corresponds to a Boolean expression, the event activation will *not* be triggered by the Boolean value.\n",
    "Instead, time drivers will check for sign changes of `lhs - rhs` at each integration time step.\n",
    "Since lhs and rhs are assumed to be continuous expressions in time, a sign change of their difference guaranties that there exists a time when lhs equals rhs.\n",
    "This time value, determined numerically by solving a root-finding problem, will be regarded as the occurrence time of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strict and non-strict inequalities are treated identically, so the actual discriminating cases are `==`, `<=`, and `>=`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<=`: expression `lhs - rhs` goes from positive to negative, meaning `lhs` becomes smaller than `rhs`;\n",
    "* `>=`: expression `lhs - rhs` goes from negative to positive, meaning `lhs` becomes greater than `rhs`;\n",
    "* `==`: expression `lhs - rhs` simply changes sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "These distinctions allow one to define directional events (different events occur when *a* exceeds *b*, and when *b* exceeds *a*), as well as one-way events.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BreakableSystem(System):\n",
    "    def setup(self):\n",
    "        self.add_inward('x', 0.0)\n",
    "        self.add_inward('x_max', 1.0)\n",
    "        self.add_event('failure', trigger=\"x > x_max\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "indicates that if `failure` ever occurs (in which case we expect the system will change, as we will see later), there is no going back, even is `x` later returns below `x_max`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive and derived events\n",
    "\n",
    "Events triggered by a zero-crossing expression, as discussed in previous section, are said to be *primitive*, as they are self-determined.\n",
    "Alternatively, events may be triggered by other events, in which case they are referred to as *secondary*, or *derived* events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Derived events can be either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Synchronized events**, simply triggered by the occurrence of another event:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  event.trigger = other_event\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Filtered events**, triggered by the occurrence of a distinct event *and* an additional condition, given as an evaluable Boolean expression. Syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  event = other_event.filter(<condition>)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Merged events**, triggered by the occurrence of one among a list of events. Syntax is:\n",

    "## Mode variables\n",

    "Mode variables are piecewise constant variables which may only change value during system transitions.\n",

    "They are declared with methods `add_inward_modevar` and `add_outward_modevar` at system setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",

    "class BreakableSystem(System):\n",
    "    def setup(self):\n",
    "        self.add_inward('x_max', 1.0)\n",

    "### Ground rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like inwards or input port variables should not be modified inside method `compute`, input mode variables should not be modified inside `transition`.\n",
    "More importantly, mode variables (either input or output) must never be modified in method `compute`, to ensure that they are indeed constant in each continuous time phase.\n",
    "The reciprocal is not true, though, as continuous time variables can be modified during transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializing mode variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Since output mode variables can be used in method `compute` but may only be changed later in method `transition`, their initial value may be of importance.\n",
    "In such cases, the value to be used at the beginning of time simulations (that is during the first continuous time phase) can be specified by argument `init` in `add_outward_modevar`.\n",
    "The value can be a constant, or an evaluable expression.\n",
    "For example, in `BreakableSystem` above, we may want to start with a value of `broken` consistent with the actual initial values of `x` and `x_max`, and thus declare:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BreakableSystem(System):\n",
    "    def setup(self):\n",
    "        self.add_inward('x_max', 1.0)\n",
    "        self.add_inward('x', 0.0)\n",
    "        self.add_outward('y', 0.0)\n",
    "        self.add_event('failure', trigger=\"x > x_max\")\n",
    "        self.add_outward_modevar('broken', False, init=\"x > x_max\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second argument of `add_outward_modevar` corresponds to the value assigned at the creation of the variable (`False`, here).\n",
    "When `init` is specified, this value can be omitted.\n",
    "If both arguments are given, though, the expression of `init` must be consistent with the type of `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex mode initialization can be achieved by specializing method `init_mode`.\n",
    "For example, an alternative implementation of `BreakableSystem` could be:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The initial values specified for output mode variables are applied *before* method `init_mode` is invoked.\n",
    "Therefore, `self.broken`, in the example above, is guaranteed to have the correct value in `init_mode`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Attribute `problem`, representing the intrinsic mathematical problem of the system, is unlocked within the scope of `init_mode`, and can therefore be modified if required.\n",

    "### Connecting mode variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode variables can be passed on from one system to another, with the same rules as inwards and outwards.\n",
    "An *output* mode variable may be connected to an *input* continuous time variable (either inward or input port variable).\n",
    "However, *input* mode variables cannot be connected to continuous time variables."

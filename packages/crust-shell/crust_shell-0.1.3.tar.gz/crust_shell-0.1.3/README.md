Crust is an interactive Linux shell written in Python, designed with a modern interface, AI integration, and enhanced tooling for common system tasks.

**Note:** I am currecntly putting crust into package managers, but it is not ready yet. Until there is an announcment, any packages made by me that are crust are not ready. 
**Edit**: Crust is available on PyPi! Use the crust-shell package to install it, as shown in the Documentation section.

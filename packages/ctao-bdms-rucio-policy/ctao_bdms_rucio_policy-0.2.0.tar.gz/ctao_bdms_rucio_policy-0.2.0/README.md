# BDMS Policy Package for Rucio

Configures permission, schema and algorithms for rucio,
including allowed lfn, RSE and user names, `extract_scope` and `lfn2pfn`.

See https://rucio.github.io/documentation/operator/policy_packages/ for more details.

The policy was started from the "generic" rucio version and adapted to meet the requirements
of the Rucio-DIRAC integration.

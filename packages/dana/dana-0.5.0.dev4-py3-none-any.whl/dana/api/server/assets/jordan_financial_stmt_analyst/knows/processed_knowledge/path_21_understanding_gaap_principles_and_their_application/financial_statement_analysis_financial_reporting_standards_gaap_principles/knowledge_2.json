  "facts": "To understand the implications of not adhering to GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) when conducting a financial analysis for potential investors, especially regarding asset valuation and liabilities, the following factual data points are required:\n\n### 1. **Balance Sheet Data**\n   - **Current Assets**: Total current assets (cash, accounts receivable, inventory) for the current period and at least the previous two years.\n   - **Non-Current Assets**: Total non-current assets (property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets) broken down by category for the same periods.\n   - **Total Assets**: The sum of current and non-current assets for the current and prior periods.\n   - **Current Liabilities**: Total current liabilities (accounts payable, short-term debt) for the current period and previous years.\n   - **Long-Term Liabilities**: Total long-term liabilities (long-term debt, deferred tax liabilities) for the current period and previous years.\n   - **Total Liabilities**: The sum of current and long-term liabilities for the current and prior periods.\n   - **Equity**: Total equity figures for the current and previous years.\n\n### 2. **Income Statement Data**\n   - **Revenue**: Total revenue figures for the current period and the last two years.\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: COGS for the current and previous years.\n   - **Operating Expenses**: Breakdown of selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) for the current and previous years.\n   - **Net Income**: Net income for the current period compared to the previous periods.\n\n### 3. **Cash Flow Statement Data**\n   - **Operating Cash Flow**: Net cash provided by operating activities for the current and prior periods.\n   - **Investing Cash Flow**: Cash used in investing activities for the current and previous years.\n   - **Financing Cash Flow**: Cash from financing activities for the current and previous years.\n\n### 4. **Key Ratios and Metrics**\n   - **Current Ratio**: (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) for the current period and previous years.\n   - **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: (Total Liabilities / Total Equity) for the current and prior periods.\n   - **Return on Assets (ROA)**: (Net Income / Total Assets) for the current and previous periods.\n   - **Return on Equity (ROE)**: (Net Income / Total Equity) for the current and previous periods.\n\n### 5. **Historical Context**\n   - **Historical Trends**: Year-over-year changes in revenue, net income, and total assets over the last 3-5 years to identify trends in growth or decline.\n   - **Industry Benchmarks**: Comparison of the company's financial ratios to industry averages to assess relative performance.\n\n### 6. **Specific Financial Statement Line Items**\n   - **Asset Valuation Methods**: Details regarding the valuation methods used (e.g., historical cost vs. fair value) for both current and non-current assets.\n   - **Liability Recognition**: Information on how liabilities are recognized and measured, particularly contingent liabilities and off-balance-sheet items.\n\n### 7. **Data Sources**\n   - **Financial Statements**: Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement for the current fiscal year and the last 2–3 years.\n   - **Notes to Financial Statements**: Disclosures regarding accounting policies, asset impairment, and liabilities that provide insights into deviations from GAAP.\n\nBy gathering this specific factual data, analysts can assess the potential implications of non-GAAP adherence, such as inflated asset valuations, understated liabilities, and overall financial misrepresentation, which could mislead potential investors and affect investment decisions.",
  "heuristics": "### Implications of Not Adhering to GAAP in Financial Analysis\n\n**1. Industry Standard Benchmarks and Thresholds:**\n   - **GAAP Compliance**: Financial statements should comply with GAAP to ensure consistency, reliability, and comparability across companies. Key benchmarks include:\n     - **Current Ratio** (Current Assets / Current Liabilities): A ratio < 1 may indicate liquidity issues.\n     - **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: A ratio > 2 suggests potential over-leverage.\n     - **Return on Equity (ROE)**: A typical benchmark is 15-20% for strong companies.\n\n**2. Rules of Thumb Used by Experienced Analysts:**\n   - **Asset Valuation**: Always prefer historical cost unless fair value measurement is stipulated. A rule of thumb is to not increase asset valuation based on optimistic projections.\n   - **Liabilities Recognition**: Recognize liabilities as soon as they are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Ignoring contingent liabilities can mislead investors.\n   - **Earnings Quality**: Favor companies with consistent earnings over those with volatile earnings, as the latter may be manipulating their financials.\n\n**3. Qualitative Factors Influencing Interpretation:**\n   - **Management Integrity**: Assess management's track record and transparency. Red flags include frequent changes in accounting policies or ambiguous disclosures.\n   - **Industry Practices**: Certain industries may have specific practices that deviate from GAAP. Understanding these nuances is crucial (e.g., revenue recognition in software vs. retail).\n   - **Economic Environment**: Macroeconomic factors may affect asset valuations. For example, a recession could lead to impairments in asset values not reflected in GAAP-compliant statements.\n\n**4. Common Pitfalls or Misleading Indicators:**\n   - **Aggressive Revenue Recognition**: Companies may recognize revenue prematurely, inflating current earnings. Watch for changes in revenue recognition policies.\n   - **Off-Balance Sheet Financing**: Failure to disclose liabilities can mislead investors about true financial health. Look for hidden debt in notes or special purpose entities.\n   - **Overstated Assets**: Companies may use aggressive estimates for asset depreciation or impairment, leading to inflated asset values.\n\n**5. Context and Applicability of Heuristics:**\n   - **When to Apply**: Use these heuristics when analyzing financial statements for investment decisions, especially in industries with complex accounting practices.\n   - **When Not to Apply**: During initial assessments of companies in emerging markets or startups, where GAAP compliance may be less relevant due to regulatory differences or the nature of early-stage financing.\n   - **Expert Judgment Criteria**: Always balance quantitative analysis with qualitative insights. Use expert judgment when faced with ambiguous situations or when the context suggests potential non-GAAP adjustments.\n\n### Conclusion\nNot adhering to GAAP can significantly distort asset valuation and liabilities, leading to misleading financial analyses that can impact investment decisions. Analysts must apply industry benchmarks, rules of thumb, and qualitative assessments to ensure a comprehensive understanding of a company’s financial health. By recognizing potential pitfalls and exercising judgment based on context, analysts can provide more accurate insights to potential investors.",

  "facts": "To assess the impact of a 10% increase in raw material costs on gross margins compared to industry peers over the next fiscal year, the following factual data points are required:\n\n### 1. Current Financial Data\n- **Revenue**: Total revenue for the current fiscal year (e.g., FY 2023) from the Income Statement.\n- **Current Raw Material Costs**: Current costs associated with raw materials from the Income Statement, including line items such as:\n  - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n  - Direct material expenses\n- **Current Gross Margin**: Current gross margin percentage calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Gross Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue} - \\text{COGS}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\times 100\n  \\]\n- **Projected Revenue**: Forecasted revenue for the next fiscal year (e.g., FY 2024).\n\n### 2. Impact of Raw Material Cost Increase\n- **Projected Increase in Raw Material Costs**: Calculate the new raw material costs after a 10% increase:\n  \\[\n  \\text{New Raw Material Costs} = \\text{Current Raw Material Costs} \\times 1.10\n  \\]\n- **New COGS Calculation**: Adjust COGS based on new raw material costs, and recalculate the gross margin for FY 2024.\n\n### 3. Historical Context\n- **Historical Revenue Trends**: Revenue figures for the past 3-5 years to evaluate growth trends.\n- **Historical Raw Material Costs**: Raw material costs for the past 3-5 years for trend analysis.\n- **Historical Gross Margin Ratios**: Gross margin percentages for the past 3-5 years to assess consistency and volatility.\n\n### 4. Peer Comparison\n- **Industry Average Gross Margins**: Gather industry benchmarks for gross margins from sources like industry reports or financial databases (e.g., Bloomberg, S&P Capital IQ).\n- **Peer Raw Material Costs**: Obtain raw material costs and gross margins from key competitors or industry peers for comparative analysis.\n\n### 5. Financial Statements Required\n- **Income Statement**: For current and historical revenue, COGS, and gross margin calculations.\n- **Balance Sheet**: For understanding total assets and liabilities that may affect operational capacity.\n- **Cash Flow Statement**: To assess cash flow implications of increased costs and working capital changes, if necessary.\n\n### 6. Quantitative Metrics and Projections\n- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Create scenarios reflecting different levels of revenue growth and raw material cost increases.\n- **Forecasted Gross Margin**: Calculate the new gross margin post raw material cost adjustment to compare against industry peers.\n\nBy gathering and analyzing this specific factual information, we can effectively assess the impact of a 10% increase in raw material costs on our gross margins and benchmark against industry peers for the upcoming fiscal year.",
  "heuristics": "To assess the impact of a 10% increase in raw material costs on gross margins compared to industry peers, follow these expert heuristics and best practices:\n\n### 1. Relevant Industry Benchmarks and Standards\n- **Gross Margin Ratio**: Understand the average gross margin ratio for your industry. For example, manufacturing sectors often see margins between 20%-40%, while retail may range from 30%-60%. A 10% increase in costs could push your margin significantly below the industry average if not managed well.\n- **Cost Structure Analysis**: Analyze the cost structure of peers to identify how much of their costs are attributable to raw materials. Industries with lower raw material dependency will be less impacted.\n- **Historical Performance**: Review historical data on how similar cost increases have affected gross margins in your industry. Look for trends during previous commodity price fluctuations.\n\n### 2. Rules of Thumb Used by Experienced Analysts\n- **Rule of 1% Margin Impact**: Typically, a 1% increase in raw material costs can lower gross margins by 0.2-0.5% depending on the company's pricing power and cost structure.\n- **Pass-Through Ability**: Evaluate if the company can pass on cost increases to customers. A company with strong brand loyalty may pass on 70%-100% of cost increases, while others may pass only 30%-50%.\n- **Margin Compression**: A 10% increase in costs should lead to a preliminary estimate of a 2-5% potential compression in gross margins if no mitigation strategies are adopted.\n\n### 3. Qualitative Factors Influencing Interpretation\n- **Pricing Power**: Assess the companyâ€™s ability to adjust prices. Strong market demand and differentiated products enhance this ability.\n- **Supplier Contracts**: Long-term contracts may mitigate immediate impacts from rising costs. Evaluate the terms and flexibility of these contracts.\n- **Market Conditions**: Consider broader economic factors, such as inflation trends and consumer spending, which can either dampen or enhance demand.\n\n### 4. Common Pitfalls or Misleading Indicators\n- **Overreliance on Historical Data**: Market dynamics can change; past performance may not accurately predict future outcomes.\n- **Ignoring Competitor Adaptations**: Peers may have better hedging strategies or operational efficiencies. Comparison should consider their response capabilities.\n- **Focusing Solely on Gross Margin**: A decrease in gross margin does not necessarily equate to poor financial health. Consider the overall profitability and operational adjustments.\n\n### 5. Context About When These Heuristics Apply\n- **Applicable Scenarios**: These heuristics are particularly useful during economic cycles when commodity prices fluctuate significantly. They help in scenario planning and stress testing.\n- **Non-Applicable Situations**: In highly volatile markets or industries undergoing rapid technological changes, traditional heuristics may not hold. In these cases, a more dynamic analysis is needed.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, to assess a 10% increase in raw material costs on gross margins, analyze industry benchmarks, apply rules of thumb regarding margin impacts, consider qualitative factors like pricing power and contractual obligations, and be cautious of common pitfalls. Always contextualize findings within the current market dynamics to enhance decision-making.",

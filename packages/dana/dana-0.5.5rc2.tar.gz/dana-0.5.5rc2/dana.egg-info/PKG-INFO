# Dana: The Agent-Native Programming Language
*Beyond AI coding assistants: write agents that learn, adapt, and improve themselves in production*

---
> **What if your agents could learn, adapt, and improve itself in production—without you?**

AI coding assistants help write better code. Agentic AI systems execute tasks autonomously. Dana represents the convergence: agent-native programming where you write `agent` instead of `class`, use context-aware `reason()` calls that intelligently adapt their output types, compose self-improving pipelines with `|` operators, and deploy functions that learn from production through POET.

## TL;DR - Get Running in 30 Seconds! 🚀

```bash
pip install dana
# If you see an 'externally-managed-environment' error on macOS/Homebrew Python, use:
# pip install dana --break-system-packages
# Or use a virtual environment:
# python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install dana
dana start
```

*No repo clone required. This launches the Dana REPL instantly.*

## Why Dana?

Dana transforms AI development from brittle, unpredictable systems to reliable, auditable automations through agent-native architecture:
- **🤖 Agent-Native**: Purpose-built for multi-agent systems with first-class agent primitives
- **🛡️ Reliable**: Built-in verification and error correction with structured state management
- **⚡ Fast**: 10x faster development cycles with clear control flow
- **🧠 Context-Aware**: `reason()` calls that adapt output types automatically based on usage
- **🔄 Self-Improving**: Functions that learn and optimize through POET in production
- **🌐 Domain-Expert**: Seamless integration of specialized knowledge and expertise
- **🔍 Transparent**: Every step is visible and debuggable through imperative programming
- **🤝 Collaborative**: Share and reuse working solutions across domains


## Core Innovation: Agent-Native Programming

Dana provides an agent-native imperative programming model that bridges development assistance with autonomous execution:

```python
# Traditional AI: Opaque, brittle
result = llm_call("analyze data", context=data)

# Dana: Transparent, self-correcting with explicit state management
analysis = reason("analyze data", context=data)  # Auto-scoped to local (preferred)
while confidence(analysis) < high_confidence:
    analysis = reason("refine analysis", context=[data, analysis])

# Clear state transitions and auditable reasoning
public:result = analysis
use("tools.report.generate", input=public:result)
```
**Agent-Native Programming**: Write agents as first-class primitives:
```python
agent FinancialAnalyst:
    def assess_portfolio(self, data):
        return reason("analyze risk factors", context=data)  # Function learns over time
```
**Context-Aware Intelligence**: Same reasoning, different output types based on usage:
```python
risk_score: float = reason("assess portfolio risk", context=portfolio)
risk_details: dict = reason("assess portfolio risk", context=portfolio)
risk_report: str = reason("assess portfolio risk", context=portfolio)
```

**Self-Improving Pipelines**: Compositional operations that optimize themselves:
```python
portfolio | risk_assessment | recommendation_engine | reporting  # Gets smarter via POET
```

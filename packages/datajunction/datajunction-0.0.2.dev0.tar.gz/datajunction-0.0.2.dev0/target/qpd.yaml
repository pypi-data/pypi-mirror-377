description: Video Qualified Play Days (VQPD). Qualified Play Days, formerly known
  as Days with a Qualified Play (DWAQP), is defined as the number of days per 28 days
  within the test period that have at least one play of greater than or equal to 6
  minutes. QPD is the engagement metric we have historically found to be most predictive
  of retention. For more details on the related research, see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qIm2BVC_uvcUvqBl4Xfwfkz5WxNKp5alzDbeDE3dTJA/edit).

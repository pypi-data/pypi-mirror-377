These are scripts from ancient civilizations or languages that are no longer in common use. They appear almost exclusively in specialized academic or historical texts.

3. Private Use Area (PUA) Characters

This is the most guaranteed category. The Private Use Areas are blocks of code points intentionally left undefined by the Unicode standard. They are meant for developers, font designers, or closed systems to define their own characters.

Since they have no standardized meaning, they should never appear in public training data. Any model that recognizes them has likely been fine-tuned on specific data or is using a byte-level tokenizer.

Character	Unicode Code Point	Name	Description
	U+E000	(Private Use Area)	The very first character in the main PUA block. Often renders as a box or question mark.
󰀀	U+F0000	(Supplementary Private Use Area-A)	A character from a supplementary PUA block. Used for things like custom icon fonts (e.g., Nerd Fonts).
	U+F118	(Private Use Area)	Font Awesome famously used the PUA for its icons before many became official Unicode symbols.
4. Special-Purpose and Obscure Formatting Characters

While some formatting characters (like the zero-width space) are known to tokenizers, others are so obscure that they are unlikely to be handled gracefully. They might not just become <unk>, but could be ignored or cause strange tokenization behavior.

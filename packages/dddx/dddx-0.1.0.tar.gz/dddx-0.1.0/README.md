# Python-DDD-Infrastructure

**A lightweight Python package for implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) building blocks.**  
Provides base classes for `ValueObject`, `Entity`, `AggregateRoot`, and `DomainEvent`, plus utility mixins for immutability and encapsulation.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ“¦ **Core DDD Building Blocks**
  - `ValueObject` â€” immutable, equality-by-value objects.
  - `Entity` â€” objects identified by unique ID.
  - `AggregateRoot` â€” transactional consistency boundary.
  - `DomainEvent` â€” base class for event-sourced or message-driven domains.

- ðŸ”’ **Utility Foundations**
  - `Immutable` base â€” automatic immutability enforcement.
  - `Encapsulated` base â€” protected internal state with controlled exposure.

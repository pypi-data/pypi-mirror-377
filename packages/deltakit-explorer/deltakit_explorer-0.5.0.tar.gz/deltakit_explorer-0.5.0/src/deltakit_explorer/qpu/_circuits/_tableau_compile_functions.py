    After the unitary blocks have been updated, layer_index_lookup is modified
    to allow room for any extra unitaries that have been added. For instance,
    when creating CompilationData, say a reset and two qubit gate are separated

    If we then compiled the reset and consequently require two unitaries following
    the reset, we need to add another layer in between the reset and two qubit gate.
    This information is tracked in layer_index_lookup, where the positive delta of
    unitary blocks before and after compilation is added to the succeeding layer
    indices to make room for the new unitaries. In the example mentioned above,
    if the reset was at layer 10, and the two qubit gate at layer 12, after
    compilation the two qubit gate would be at layer 13, and the dictionary would
    have entry {12: 13} to reflect this. Then when the circuit is reconstructed from
    CompilationData, the layer indices recorded before compilation are looked up in
    the layer_index_lookup dictionary to add the gates at the right layer indices

    Parameters
    ----------
    comp_data : CompilationData
        Circuit to compile, in CompilationData form.
    layer_index_lookup : Dict[int, int]
        Accompanying layer index lookup dictionary, used to ensure
        gates added for compilation do not clash in layers.
    native_gate_set : NativeGateSetAndTimes
        Native gate set to try compiling to.
    comp_dict : TableauDict
        Compilation dictionary containing the shortest discovered gate
        expression for a given tableau.
    gate_exchange_dict : EquivalentTableauDict
        Dictionary containing equivalent expressions in terms of different
        (but still native) gates of each tableau in comp_dict. Used for
        two-qubit gate compilation where equivalent gate expressions
        for a given tableau may give better compilations.
    up_to_paulis: bool
        Specify whether compilation should happen only up to Pauli terms.
        By default, False.
    allow_terms_to_mutate : bool
        For two qubit gate compilation, will allow the case of pulling a single-qubit Pauli
        term through a two-qubit gate such that the resulting (possibly two-qubit) Pauli has
        a different term on either qubit.
        E.g., pulling an X through a CZ from the first qubit mutates into a Z term
        on the second qubit.
        By default, True.
    allow_terms_to_multiply : bool
        For two qubit gate compilation, will allow the case of pulling a term through a
        two-qubit gate such that a second term on the other qubit is created. E.g., pulling
        an X through a CX from the first qubit mutates into an X on the first qubit and an
        X on the second qubit.
        By default, True.

    Params
    ------
    circuit : Circuit
        deltakit_circuit.Circuit to compile.
    native_gate_set : NativeGateSetAndTimes
        Native gate set to compile to.
    up_to_paulis: bool, optional
        Specify whether compilation should happen only up to Pauli terms.
        By default, False.
    allow_terms_to_mutate : bool, optional
        For two qubit gate compilation, will allow the case of pulling a single-qubit Pauli
        term through a two-qubit gate such that the resulting (possibly two-qubit) Pauli has
        a different term on either qubit.
        E.g, pulling an X through a CZ from the first qubit mutates into a Z term
        on the second qubit.
        By default, True.
    allow_terms_to_multiply : bool, optional
        For two qubit gate compilation, will allow the case of pulling a term through a
        two-qubit gate such that a second term on the other qubit is created. E.g, pulling
        an X through a CX from the first qubit mutates into an X on the first qubit and an
        X on the second qubit.
        By default, True.

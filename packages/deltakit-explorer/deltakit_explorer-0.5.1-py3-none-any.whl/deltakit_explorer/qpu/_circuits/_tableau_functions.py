    Create a compilation dictionary that specifies, for a given set of single
    qubit native gates, the lowest length operator-product per tableau. To achieve this,
    starting from the identity, multiply in all the native single-qubit gates to create
    length one operators and add the unique tableaus to a dictionary, with tableau as
    key and corresponding operator as value. Then progressively multiply in the single-
    qubit native gates creating length 2, 3 etc. operators, keeping only the minimum-length
    ones for a unique set of tableaus, up to the maximum of 24, or until no new tableaus
    are found for a given operator length.

    Parameters
    ----------
    native_gates : NativeGateSetAndTimes
        Native gate set. If `one_qubit_gates` is empty, return
        a dictionary only containing the identity.
    max_length : Optional[int], optional
        Maximum length of operators to be considered, used to put an upper
        limit on which combinations of the single-qubit native gates should
        be created.
        By default, None, which will let the program run until it either
        finds all tableaus or determines there are none left to find.
    up_to_paulis : bool, optional
        If True, then when creating the Tableau dictionary, only consider
        Tableaus that are equivalent up to Pauli terms. This means not
        considering the sign of the conjugation result. The maximum number
        of unique Tableaus then becomes 6.
        By default, False.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[TableauDict, EquivalentTableauDict]
        A tuple containing the compilation dictionary, and the equivalent

    Given a string/block of unitary gates, and specifying which projector
    this unitary block is preceded by (reset or measurement), use the Tableau
    to work out if this set of projector + unitaries can be reduced to a
    shorter set of gates. This requires comparing Tableaus that are identical in the
    conjugation corresponding to the basis of the projector. E.g, if two Tableaus
    conjugate +Z to +X, then the Tableau with the shortest gate representation may
    be chosen to follow a reset or measurement in the Z basis. Likewise for the other
    bases. If the given set of unitaries is empty, the Identity will be returned.
    If the compilation dictionary contains no tableau that matches that of the
    `unitary_block`, then a KeyError is thrown, as this may cause a return value in

    projector_before_unitaries : Union[MZ, RZ, MX, RX, MY, RY]
        Specify which projector is immediately before

    up_to_paulis : bool, Optional
        If True, the tableau computed for the unitary block

        Dictionary to provide extra possible gate combinations for a given Tableau.

        an alternative set of gates that may allow some further simplification.
        By default, empty dictionary.
    up_to_paulis : bool, optional
        If True, will consider tableaus equivalent if they are equivalent up
        to pauli terms. E.g, the sign of the tableau terms are not considered.
    allow_terms_to_mutate : bool, optional
        If True, will allow the case of pulling a single-qubit Pauli term through a
        two-qubit gate such that the resulting (possibly two-qubit) Pauli has a different
        term on either qubit.
        E.g, pulling an X through a CZ from the first qubit mutates into a Z term on the second qubit.
        By default, True.
    allow_terms_to_multiply : bool, optional = True
        If True, will allow the case of pulling a term through a two-qubit gate

def _extract_structure_from_circuit(
    circuit: Circuit,
) -> CompilationData:
    """
    From the given circuit, extract the data relevant for compiling the circuit using
    the Tableau. This means we need to have collections of one-qubit unitary blocks
    that precede or succeed reset, measurement and two-qubit gates. In order to
    simplify compilation and reduce implementation complexity, each collection of
    reset, measurement and two-qubit gates will point to a shared memory of unitary
    blocks. This way, when one set of unitary blocks is updated after compilation of,
    for example, resets, the result will automatically propagate forward for when the
    same block is reconsidered but as a part of a different gate, say, a measurement
    later on in the circuit. This removes the complexity of having to keep track of
    which gates have compiled at what time, for which gate etc.

    The data structures are as follows:
        unitary blocks: returned as first item in the tuple.
            Stored as a dictionary of int keys and List[OneQubitCliffordGate] values.
            The key is the index of the unitary block that is pointed to by the reset, measurement
            and two-qubit gate dictionaries. The list is the unitary block itself.
        SpecialGateDict
            This data structure stores the relevant data for the `special` gates, those being
            reset, measurement and two-qubit gates. This dictionary has Tuple[int, Qubit] keys,
            and Dict["preceding": int, "succeeding": int] values.
            The key is (GateLayer index of gate, Qubit of gate, Gate). The value is two integers keyed
            by strings `preceding` and `succeeding` that point to a unitary block via that block's
            index.

        For example, if there is the small circuit
        ---RZ(0)--H(0)--MZ(0)---
        Then there are 3 unitary blocks here:
            (1) the empty block preceding the reset,
            (2) the block inbetween the reset and measurement,
            (3) the block succeeding the measurement
        In this case, unitary_blocks' data is
            {0: [], 1: [H(0)], 2: []}
            with indices corresponding to above labelling.
        Then, the reset dict would be:
            {(0, Qubit(0), RZ): {"preceding": 0, "succeeding": 1}}
        and the measurement dict:
            {(0, Qubit(0), MZ): {"preceding": 1, "succeeding": 2}}
        Where you can see that the reset and measurement dicts simply point to the unitary blocks,
        such that if unitary block 1 is compiled at some point, any changes will be propagated to
        later compilations automatically. If it is updated after compiling resets, the changes
        will be present when measurements are considered.

    The algorithm to collect such data structures from the circuit is as follows:
        For each gate layer:
            For each qubit in layer:
                if it is a special gate:
                    (0) all gates encountered on this qubit so far are the unitary block preceding this gate
                    (1) update the relevant dict: {(layer index, qubit, gate): {"preceding": unitary_block_index}}
                    (2) reset (clear) the gates_encountered dict for this qubit
                    (3) mark current special gate as most recent special gate on this qubit
                    current unitary block may also be a "succeeding" for the most recent special gate on this qubit
                    (4) check most recent special gate on this qubit
                    (5) if exists, update as above but with "succeeding" key
                else:
                    add it to gates encountered on this qubit so far
        If not gate layer, append to none-GateLayer struct.

        do a final update using the remaining encountered gates per qubit, as these
        correspond to gates at the end of the circuit and must be stored as "succeeding"
        of all the last encountered special gates on each qubit.

        if a qubit had no resets, measurements or two-qubit gates on it, then we drop it from the circuit.

        Dictionary mapping unitary block indices to lists of single-qubit gates.
    gate_unitary_block_info : Dict[str, int]
        For the given special gate, a dictionary describing which unitary blocks

    circuit_layers : DefaultDict[int, GateLayer]
        DefaultDictionary storing the GateLayers of the circuit to be constructed.
        Will be edited by adding gates to GateLayers as per the other parameters.
    layer_index : int
        Current layer index, to know which layer indices to add gates to preceding
        and succeeding the special gate.
    unitary_blocks_already_added : Set[int]
        Set to look up which unitary blocks have already been added, so we do not

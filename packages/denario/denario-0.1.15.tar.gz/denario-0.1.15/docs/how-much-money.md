# How Much Money Is Needed?

With $10, it is possible to generate hundreds of ideas, methods, and draft hundreds of papers, provided the analysis has already been completed. Running analyses (i.e., obtaining actual results) remains inexpensive when using lightweight models such as gpt-4o-mini. Most papers produced with the first public release of Denario were generated using either gemini-2.5-pro or gpt-4.1, which are more resource-intensive and costly. Generating research analysis for a single idea typically costs around $2–$5 with these models.

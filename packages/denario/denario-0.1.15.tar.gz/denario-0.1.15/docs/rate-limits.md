# Rate Limits

New users are likely to encounter token rate limits when using OpenAI models. This may cause Denario to pause temporarily if too much text or code is generated. To increase token rate limits, refer to [OpenAI's rate limit documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

If rate limits are a problem for you, please contact us at [denario.astropilot.ai@gmail.com](mailto:denario.astropilot.ai@gmail.com).

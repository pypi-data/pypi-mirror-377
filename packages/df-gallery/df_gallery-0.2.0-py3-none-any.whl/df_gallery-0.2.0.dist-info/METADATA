# df-gallery

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flicht/df-gallery/refs/heads/master/demo.png)

Generate a fast, filterable, shuffleable HTML image gallery from a CSV. Great for poking at large image folders with rich metadata filters (pandas-ish syntax in the browser).

## Install
```bash
# from PyPI 
pip install df-gallery

# OR for development
uv venv && uv pip install -e .[dev]

## Usage

df-gallery path/to/images.csv \
  --out gallery.html \
  --path-col filename \
  --img-root /absolute/or/relative/prefix \
  --relative-to-html \
  --chunk 500 \
  --tile 200 \
  --title "My Image Gallery"
```

or `dfg`

 The CSV must contain a column with image paths or URLs (default: filename). All columns become filterable fields in the UI.

 ## Development
uv run pytest
uv build            # builds wheel + sdist
uv publish          # publishes to PyPI (set PYPI token first)

# django-glide

This is a Django library to add support to Glide JS in your templates

It supports:

 * Django 3
 * Django 4
 * Django 5

## Installation

```sh
pip install django-glide
```

## Setup

First, add "django_glide" to your list of `INSTALLED_APPS`.


Then either in your base template (to load on all pages) or just in the template you need, add:

```html
{% load glide_tags %}
{% glide_assets %}
```

Then to actually use a glide based carousel, use this in your template:

```html
{% load glide_tags %}

...

{% glide_carousel my_images carousel_id="hero" type="carousel" perView=3 autoplay=3000 %}
```

All the options listed on the example above can be found here: https://glidejs.com/docs/options/ .
Note that all options are using basic types such as integer, boolean, float or string, at the exception of the `breakpoints`, `peek` and `classes` fields which are a complex object. Here is an example on how you can use it:

```html
{% glide_carousel events carousel_id="events" type="carousel" perView=3.5 breakpoints='{"600": {"perView": 2.5}}' %}
```

And then in your view, return an object in the context following this format:

```python
my_images = [
    {"image": "/static/img/slide1.jpg", "alt": "Slide 1"},
    {"image": "/static/img/slide2.jpg", "alt": "Slide 2"},
    {"image": "/static/img/slide3.jpg", "alt": "Slide 3"},
]
```

## Using custom template

By default, the template shipped with the library is basic, it can either load an image or some text.

This library uses 2 templates, one for the carousel itself and one for each individual slides.

### Slide template

You can set a global slide template by creating an HTML jinja file and referencing it in your settings like so:

```python
GLIDE_DEFAULT_SLIDE_TEMPLATE = "myapp/slide.html"
```

Or you can set a slide template for a given carousel like so:


```html
{% glide_carousel my_custom_data carousel_id="hero" slide_template="myapp/slide.html" type="carousel" perView=3 autoplay=3000 %}
```

### Carousel template

You can set a global carousel template by creating an HTML jinja file and referencing it in your settings like so:

```python
GLIDE_DEFAULT_CAROUSEL_TEMPLATE = "myapp/carousel.html"
```

Or you can set a carousel template for a given carousel like so:


```html
{% glide_carousel my_custom_data carousel_id="hero" carousel_template="myapp/carousel.html" type="carousel" perView=3 autoplay=3000 %}
```

## Arrows

You can use the [arrows control](https://glidejs.com/docs/setup#arrows) either by:

 * Passing `arrows="true"`
 * Passing `arrows_template="xxx"`

## Bullets

You can use the [bullets control](https://glidejs.com/docs/setup#bullets) either by:

 * Passing `bullets="true"`
 * Passing `bullets_template="xxx"`

## Changing the way GlideJS is loaded

By default, this library uses lastest Glide of the jsdelivr CDN, if you want to change this, you can modify one (or all) of the following settings:

```python
GLIDE_JS_URL = "my new URL to fetch the JS"
GLIDE_CSS_CORE_URL = "my new URL to fetch the core CSS"
GLIDE_CSS_THEME_URL = "my new URL to fetch the theme CSS, if you set as None, it won't be loaded"
```

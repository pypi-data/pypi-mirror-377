# DSNS: The Deep Space Network Simulator

The Deep Space Network Simulator (DSNS) is an event-based network simulator designed for efficient simulation of satellite networks and interplanetary communication, to facilitate protocol testing and development.
The paper introducing it can be found on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04317).

When using DSNS, please cite the following paper: **"DSNS: The Deep Space Network Simulator"**.

## Documentation

Further documentation can be found here: https://ssloxford.github.io/DSNS/


## Installation

DSNS is distributed on PyPI, and can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip3 install dsns
```

However, many use cases will require modifications to the source code.
For this reason, we recommend installation from source, using the `--editable` flag to ensure the code can be updated without requiring reinstallation.
This can be done as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssloxford/dsns.git
cd dsns
pip3 install --editable .
```

Dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`, at the root of the repository.
We recommend the use of a virtual environment to reduce the likelihood of dependency conflicts.


## Usage

We recommend looking in the `examples` directory for usage examples, or at the documentation for further instruction.

> [!NOTE]
> The examples in `examples/paper` require simulation logs that are not bundled with this repository due to their size, and are provided for reference only.
> The logs can be obtained by running `examples/ccsds_reference.py` and `examples/custom_reference.py` with the arguments shown at the bottom of the respective file, or by contacting the authors.


## Contributing

We welcome any contributions to DSNS, including but not limited to improved documentation, refactoring, new features, examples, and reference scenarios.
To make a contribution, please add an issue to the tracker or create a pull request, and we will aim to merge any changes shortly.
Please note that any code changes must come with corresponding changes to the documentation.

# DuckFlow ü¶Ü

**Have your ducks in a row, and watch them go.**  
A playful pipeline framework for chaining AI and logic tasks, built around the metaphor of ducks and flocks.

---

## üê• Core Concepts

- **Duck** ‚Üí A modular unit (task handler). Example: query DuckDuckGo, call OpenAI, format CSV.
- **Flock** ‚Üí A pipeline definition, chaining ducks together into a workflow.
- **Pond** ‚Üí Your environment/configuration where ducks swim (e.g. knowledge base files, `.env`).

---

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/duckflow.git
cd duckflow
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Create a `.env` file with your keys:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-yourkeyhere
```

---

## ü¶Ü Example: Quack Test

A toy demo duck that simply quacks back your input.

```bash
duckflow quack_test "Hello DuckFlow"   --ducks-dir ./examples/ducks   --flock-file ./examples/flock.json
```

Output:
```
Running flock: quack_test
Duck quack (type=quack_node) produced output: Quack! You said: Hello DuckFlow
Final flock result: Quack! You said: Hello DuckFlow
```

---

## üåä Example: Duck Pond Research

A flock where one duck does research and another summarizes with OpenAI, augmented by a local knowledge base.

```bash
duckflow duckpond_summary "Why do ducks love ponds?"   --ducks-dir ./examples/ducks   --flock-file ./examples/flock.json
```

Possible output:
```
Running flock: duckpond_summary
Duck duckpond_researcher (type=duckduckgo_research) produced output: Related info: Ducks are aquatic birds...; Ponds support ecosystems...
Duck duckpond_summarizer (type=openai_chat) produced output:
- Ducks love ponds because they provide food, safety, and social space.
- Ponds support ecosystems that ducks thrive on.
- Ducklings learn foraging in ponds.
Final flock result: - Ducks love ponds because they provide food, safety, and social space. ...
```

# Easy Dataset Share

`easy-dataset-share` helps AI researchers share datasets responsibly. It prevents evaluation contamination by making datasets easy for researchers to use but hard for automated scrapers to ingest.

The `easy-dataset-share` CLI tool provides basic protection against scraping by making the dataset text itself less scrapeable.

However, sophisticated actors will still be able to scrape your content. Rather than providing unsophisticated further defenses which inconvenience real users, we think you should outsource that defense to a provider like CloudFlare. We wrote an easy tutorial on signing up with CloudFlare Turnstile, which is like CAPTCHA but a. actually effective and b. doesn't inconvenience your real users. See [WEB_HOSTING_GUIDE.md](WEB_HOSTING_GUIDE.md)

## Features

- **Canary markers**: Unique identifiers to detect if your dataset was used for training.
- **Hash verification**: Ensures that adding & removing canaries does not alter the dataset.
- **Zip and password-protect**: Zips the data to make it not readable in plaintext by basic crawlers. Optional password-based encryption as well.
- **Default best practices**: Generates a conservative `robots.txt` and a Terms of Service which prohibits use for AI training.
- **Clean removal**: Removes all protection while preserving original data (use hash verification to confirm data-integrity).
- **Web hosting**: Deploy a protected download site with Cloudflare-Turnstile (a CAPTCHA-replacement)- see [WEB_HOSTING_GUIDE.md](WEB_HOSTING_GUIDE.md)

## Installation

```bash
pip install easy-dataset-share
```

## Quick Start

### Protect a dataset
```bash
easy-dataset-share protect-dir /path/to/your/dataset
```

### Unprotect and clean
```bash
easy-dataset-share unprotect-dir <path/to/your/dataset>.zip --remove-canaries
```

### Verify integrity
```bash
easy-dataset-share hash /path/to/dataset
```

## Options
Run `easy-dataset-share --help` or for a subcommand `easy-dataset-share protect-dir --help`. To get a description of the options available.

## How it Works
1. **Hash** original dataset for integrity baseline
2. **Add** canary markers throughout the dataset
3. **Package** with robots.txt and optional encryption
4. **Verify** integrity when unprotecting (canaries removed, data unchanged)

## Example Workflow
```bash
# Protect with a password
easy-dataset-share protect-dir <path/to/your/dataset>

# Share <path/to/your/dataset>.zip publicly (the zip file contains your protected dataset)

# Recipients unprotect and remove canaries
easy-dataset-share unprotect-dir <path/to/your/dataset>.zip --remove-canaries
# Output shows: "ðŸ“Š Dataset hash: abc123..." (matches original)
```
Use `-p your-password` to add a password when you zip (and for others to use when they unzip - will now be .zip.enc)
Use `-v` for verbose output to see hashing details and canary operations.


## Notes about licensing for `Robots.txt` (Text & Data Mining (TDM) opt-out)

The `robots.txt` generated by this helper add TDM protections, see [EDRlab](https://www.edrlab.org/open-standards/tdmrep/) for more information.


## Hosting with Anti-Scraper Protection
For datasets hosted outside of Hugging Face, we **strongly recommend** using [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/) to add an additional layer of protection against automated AI scrapers. See [WEB_HOSTING_GUIDE.md](WEB_HOSTING_GUIDE.md) for a guide on how to do this.


This layered approach (dataset protection + hosting protection) provides comprehensive defense against automated data harvesting while maintaining accessibility for legitimate researchers.

# Maintainence + Development
This is meant to be a collaborative and community project. Please feel encouraged to make PRs to update this repo!

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Responsible-Dataset-Sharing/easy-dataset-share.git
cd easy-dataset-share
pip install -e .
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

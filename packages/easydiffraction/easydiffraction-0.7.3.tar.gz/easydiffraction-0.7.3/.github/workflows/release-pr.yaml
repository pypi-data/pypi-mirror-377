# This workflow creates an automated release PR from `develop` into `main`.
#
# Usage:
#   - Triggered manually via workflow_dispatch.
#   - Creates a PR titled "Release: merge develop into master".
#   - Adds the label "[maintainer] auto-pull-request" so it is excluded from changelogs.
#   - The PR body makes clear that this is automation only (no review needed).

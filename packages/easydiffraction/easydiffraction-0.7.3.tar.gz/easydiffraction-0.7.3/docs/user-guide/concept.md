# Concept

Typical data processing in a diffraction experiment consists of three main
steps:  
**data acquisition**, **data reduction**, and **data analysis**.

## Data Acquisition

Data acquisition involves collecting raw data from the diffractometer (also
referred to as the instrument) during a neutron or X-ray diffraction experiment.

The data is recorded by a detector that measures the intensity of the diffracted
radiation as a function of angle or time. The radiation is scattered by the
crystalline specimen (also called the sample), whose structural properties are
being studied.

## Data Reduction

Data reduction involves processing the raw data to remove background noise,
correct for instrumental effects, and convert the data into a more usable
format. The goal is to produce a clean and reliable dataset suitable for
analysis.

## Data Analysis

Data analysis uses the reduced data to extract meaningful information about the
sample. This may include determining the crystal or magnetic structure,
identifying phases, performing quantitative analysis, etc.

Analysis often involves comparing experimental data with data calculated from a
crystallographic model to validate and interpret the results. For powder
diffraction, techniques such as Rietveld or Le Bail refinement may be used.

In EasyDiffraction, we focus on this **model-dependent analysis**. A model is
built using prior knowledge of the system, and its parameters are optimized to
achieve the best agreement between experimental and calculated diffraction data.

By "model", we usually refer to a **crystallographic model** of the sample. This
includes unit cell parameters, space group, atomic positions, thermal
parameters, and more. However, the term "model" also encompasses experimental
aspects such as instrumental resolution, background, peak shape, etc. Therefore,
EasyDiffraction separates the model into two parts: the **sample model** and the
**experiment**.

The aim of data analysis is to refine the structural parameters of the sample by
minimizing the difference (or **residual**) between the experimental and
calculated data â€” and this is exactly where EasyDiffraction comes into play.

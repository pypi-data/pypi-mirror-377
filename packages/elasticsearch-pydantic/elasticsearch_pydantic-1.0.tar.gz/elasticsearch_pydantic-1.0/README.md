# üîç elasticsearch-pydantic

Use the [Elasticsearch DSL](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py) with [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) models.

This minimal library is for those who...

- ... want to benefit from Pydantic's [extensive validation and type checking](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/) ecosystem,
- ... want the convenient and idiomatic [persistence layer](https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#persistence) and [query DSL](https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#search) of Elasticsearch DSL,
- ... and do not want to reimplement everything from scratch.

To interconnect the Elasticsearch DSL and Pydantic, we override a limited set of methods from the Elasticsearch [`Document`](https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#elasticsearch_dsl.Document) and `InnerDoc` base classes with Pydantic's [`BaseModel`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel) functionality. Elasticsearch field types are inferred from the model's type annotations and can be overridden by using [`Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated) type hints.

## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```shell
pip install elasticsearch-pydantic
```

## Usage

To migrate from Elasticsearch DSL to `elasticsearch-pydantic`, just change your ORM classes to inherit from `elasticsearch_pydantic.BaseDocument` instead of `elasticsearch_dsl.Document`. Then, gradually replace your field definitions with Pydantic type annotations.

For example, in Elasticsearch DSL, you would typically define a document like this:

```python
from elasticsearch_dsl import Document, Text, Date

class BlogPost(Document):
    title = Text()
    content = Text()
    published_at = Date()
```

With `elasticsearch-pydantic`, you can define the same document using Pydantic models:

```python
from elasticsearch_pydantic import BaseDocument

class BlogPost(BaseDocument):
    title: str
    content: str
    published_at: datetime
```

And that's about it!
You now get all the type-safety and validation benefits of Pydantic, while still being able to use the powerful features of Elasticsearch DSL.

Most Pydantic types are naturally mapped to Elasticsearch field types.
To learn more about the field type mappings, see the [mapping code](./elasticsearch_pydantic/__init__.py).

### Annotated types

You can use [`Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated) type hints to customize the Elasticsearch field types:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from elasticsearch_dsl import Text, Keyword
from elasticsearch_pydantic import BaseDocument

class BlogPost(BaseDocument):
    title: Annotated[str, Text(analyzer="standard")]
    tags: Annotated[list[str], Keyword]
```

### Field type aliases

For convenience, `elasticsearch-pydantic` provides type aliases for all standard Elasticsearch field types:

```python
from elasticsearch_pydantic import BaseDocument, TextField, KeywordField

class BlogPost(BaseDocument):
    title: TextField
    tags: list[KeywordField]
```

### Compatibility

This library works fine with any of the following Pip packages installed:

- [`elasticsearch-dsl<8.12.0`](https://pypi.org/project/elasticsearch-dsl/)
- [`elasticsearch6-dsl`](https://pypi.org/project/elasticsearch6-dsl/)
- [`elasticsearch7-dsl`](https://pypi.org/project/elasticsearch7-dsl/)
- [`elasticsearch8-dsl<8.12.0`](https://pypi.org/project/elasticsearch8-dsl/)

The `elasticsearch-pydantic` library will automatically detect which Elasticsearch DSL is installed.

## Development

To build this package and contribute to its development you need to install the `build`, `setuptools` and `wheel` packages:

```shell
pip install build setuptools wheel
```

(On most systems, these packages are already pre-installed.)

### Development installation

Install package and test dependencies:

```shell
pip install -e .[tests,tests-es6]   # For elasticsearch-dsl~=6.0
pip install -e .[tests,tests-es6x]  # For elasticsearch6-dsl
pip install -e .[tests,tests-es7]   # For elasticsearch-dsl~=7.0
pip install -e .[tests,tests-es7x]  # For elasticsearch7-dsl
pip install -e .[tests,tests-es8]   # For elasticsearch-dsl~=8.0
pip install -e .[tests,tests-es8x]  # For elasticsearch8-dsl
```

### Testing

Verify your changes against the test suite to verify.

```shell
ruff check .  # Code format and LINT
mypy .        # Static typing
pytest .      # Unit tests
```

Please also add tests for your newly developed code.

### Build wheels

Wheels for this package can be built with:

```shell
python -m build
```

        est is using the Qt library. A word of caution is to be provided. If users develop and distribute software using modules accessing Qt by means of Riverbank Computing Qt bindings PyQt4 or PyQt5, those users will be conditioned by the license of their PyQt4/5 software (GPL or commercial). If the end user does not own a commercial license of PyQt4 or PyQt5 and wishes to be free of any distribution condition, (s)he should be able to use PySide because it uses the LGPL license.
        
        It can also be used as an Orange3 add-on. If you wan't to distribute Orange you must stick to there license (GNU [GPL-3.0]+ license)

# Est: Spectroscopy workflows

`est` is a library to define workflows for X-ray Absorption Structure analysis.
The analysis can be based on either [PyMca](https://github.com/vasole/pymca) or [Larch](https://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/)

![An example workflow](https://ewoksest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/workflow_example.png)

## Quick start

```python
pip install est[full] pyqt5
ewoks-canvas
```

See then the _Example workflows_ to get started.

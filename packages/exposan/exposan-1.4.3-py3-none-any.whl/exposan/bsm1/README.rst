bsm1: Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1
======================================

Summary
-------
This module implements the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1). [1]_ The code for process modeling and dynamic simulation has been verified against the MATLAB/Simulink [2]_ implementation developed by International Water Association (IWA) Task Group on Benchmarking of Control Strategies. The ``data`` folder contains the outputs from MATLAB/Simulink results (``matlab_exported_data_asm1.xlsx`` and ``matlab_workspace_asm1.mat``) for comparison.

    *BSM1 system layout: two anoxic suspended-growth bioreactors followed by three aerobic bioreactors and a secondary clarifier*

The Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM1) [3]_ was used to describe biochemical processes and a simple 1-D 10-layer settling model [4]_ was used for the secondary clarifier.

As of now, the BSM1 system can be simulated dynamically with constant or dynamic influents. Fixed aeration is enabled. Idealized aeration control can also be implemented by setting target dissolved oxygen concentration.

To reproduce the results and figures included in Li and Zhang et al. [5]_ (archived in a separate `repository <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan-Introductory-Publication-Archive>`_), directly run ``analyses.py``. You can find a full list of the packages in the environment used to generate the results in `qsdsan.yml <https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan/blob/main/exposan/bwaise/qsdsan.yml>`_. Note that the environment was in macOS, other OS users can consult it for the versions of the dependency packages and install them accordingly.

If you want to look at unit/system diagram, you will want to have the package ``Graphviz`` correctly installed in your environment (read more about this on `QSDsan's documentation <https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FAQ.html#graphviz>`_).

To perform a simulation of the BSM1 model, you can import the module (as shown below) or directly run the ``system.py`` script. Influent loadings, initial conditions, model parameters, system settings, and solver options can all be customized in the same script.

Future development will include:

    - Design and costing algorithms of unit operations in the system
    - Aeration control with PI or PID controller

Note that minor modifications have been made to ASM1, specifically:

    - Compared to the original model [3]_, a component ``S_N2`` was added for mass conservation of nitrogen.
    - Compared to the updated model [6]_, the ammonia limitation term was removed from the rate equations of the
      heterotrophic growth processes to be consistent with GPS-X and the MATLAB Simulink [2]_ implementation.

The most updated version of ASM1 per Rieger et al. [6]_ is available in `QSDsan <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan/blob/main/qsdsan/processes>`_. You can choose to work with the updated version by changing the file path in the ``system.py`` script or replace the ``_asm1.tsv`` file with the one in `QSDsan <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan/tree/main/qsdsan/data/process_data>`_.

Biochemical process model parameters such as ASM1's stoichiometric or kinetic parameters can be customized upon and after initiation of the ``CompiledProcesses`` object. See `process <https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Process.html#compiledprocesses>`_
module for more details.

Unit operation settings, such as, reactor dimensions, number of settling layers, and settling parameters, can also be customized upon and after initiation of the corresponding ``SanUnit``.


Perform dynamic simulations
---------------------------
Dynamic simulation of the BSM1 system can be performed with the built in `simulate`method. A system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is compiled upon the initiation of the `System` object. Detailed settings regarding the ODE solver can be adjusted by passing keyword arguments to the `simulate` method. See `biosteam <https://biosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/System.html#biosteam.System.simulate>`_ for more information.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # Simulate with default solver and default settings.
    >>> # Set the dynamic tracker prior to simulation
    >>> # if you want to track the state of a certain stream or unit
    >>> RAS = sys.flowsheet.stream.RAS
    >>> O1 = sys.flowsheet.unit.O1
    >>> sys.set_dynamic_tracker(RAS, O1)
    >>> sys.simulate(t_span=(0,10), method='BDF')
    Simulation completed.
    >>> # The state variables in each unit can be plotted over time
    >>> fig, axis = RAS.scope.plot_time_series(('S_S', 'S_NH')) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS

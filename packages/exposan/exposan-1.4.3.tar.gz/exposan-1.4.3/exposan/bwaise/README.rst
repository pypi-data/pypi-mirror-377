bwaise: Sanitation Alternatives in Bwaise, Uganda
=================================================

Summary
-------
Systems included in this module are based on Scenarios A-C as described in Trimmer et al. [1]_ and named as "sysA", "sysB", and "sysC". Previous scripts developed for modeling and analyses of the systems can be found in another `repository <https://github.com/QSD-Group/Bwaise-sanitation-alternatives>`_.

Results generated from this module have been benchmarked against Trimmer et al. [1]_ and you can find the result comparison in the ``comparison`` folder. The folder ``data`` contains data needed to run the module, and ``figures`` and ``results`` contain the archived figures and results generated for Li and Zhang et al. [2]_ 

To reproduce the results and figures included in Li and Zhang et al. [2]_ (archived in a separate `repository <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan-Introductory-Publication-Archive>`_), directly run ``systems.py``/``analyses.py`` (before running ``analyses.py``, you'll want to adjust the number of simulations, and you'll need to run from scratch the first time you run to generate the data). You'll need the package `adjustText <https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText>`_ in addition to ``EXPOsan``'s requirements.

You can find a full list of the packages in the environment used to generate the results in `qsdsan.yml <https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan/blob/main/exposan/bwaise/qsdsan.yml>`_. Note that the environment was in macOS, other OS users can consult it for the versions of the dependency packages and install them accordingly.

 Additionally, you will want to have the package ``Graphviz`` correctly installed in your environment (read more about this on `QSDsan's documentation <https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FAQ.html#graphviz>`_).

To run the module developed in Trimmer et al. [1]_, refer to the comparison dir, you can run the `Bwaise_sanitation_model.py` script in either `baseline <https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan/tree/main/exposan/bwaise/comparison/baseline>`_ or `uncertainty <https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan/tree/main/exposan/bwaise/comparison/uncertainty>`_.

Note that minor modifications have been made in the scripts, specifically:

    - Baseline characterization factor of the electricity has been changed in the input spreadsheet
    - Degradation algorithm for ``dehydration_vault`` has been updated in ``decentralized_storage.py``
    - Degradation algorithms for all treatment functions with first-order decay have been updated in ``treatment.py``
    - The emission calculation of `ABR` has been updated.

The change in the spreadsheet is denoted by red font with a note, and all changes in the scripts have been noted with `#!!!`, the original value/codes are saved either in the spreadsheet note or as comments.

Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment (TEA/LCA)
------------------------------------------------------------
TEA and LCA are performed through :class:`biosteam.TEA` and :class:`LCA` objects and named as "teaA", "lcaA", etc.

    >>> # There are also handy functions to allow you quickly see important results
    >>> bw.print_summaries(bw.sysA) # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> # bw.sysA.save_report('full_file_path.xlsx')


Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses
------------------------------------
Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses are performed through :class:`Model` objects. Three models (``modelA`` to ``modelC`` corresponding to ``sysA`` to ``sysC``, respectively) have been added with all the uncertainty parameters and ranges according to Trimmer et al. [1]_.

You can make changes (e.g., add or remove parameters, change uncertainty ranges) to these models or construct your own ones.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # Run the default model for `sysA`
    >>> modelA = bw.create_model('A')
    >>> # Try use larger samples, here is just to get a quick demo result
    >>> # The result will be automatically saved under the results folder
    >>> bw.run_uncertainty(modelA, N=10) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    function `run_uncertainty`
    Total ...


``QSDsan`` also have built-in functions for advanced global sensitivity analyses and plotting functions, refer to the `stats <https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stats.html>`_ module for examples.

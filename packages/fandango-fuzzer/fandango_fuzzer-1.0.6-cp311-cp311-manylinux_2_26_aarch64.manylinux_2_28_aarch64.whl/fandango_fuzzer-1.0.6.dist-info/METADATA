         to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of
         the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.
         
         3. Communication of the Source Code
         
         The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
         Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
         provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
         along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates,
         in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository
         where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the
         Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
         
         4. Limitations on copyright
         
         Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits
         from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners
         in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable
         limitations thereto.
         
         5. Obligations of the Licensee
         
         The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
         obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:
         
         Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
         trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
         disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and
         a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or
         communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent
         notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.
         
         Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the
         Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be
         done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence
         unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of
         the Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee
         (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions
         on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the
         Licence.
         
         Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative
         Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed
         under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done
         under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,
         ‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to
         this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence
         conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
         Compatible Licence shall prevail.
         
         Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the
         Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or
         indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available
         for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
         
         Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required
         for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
         reproducing the content of the copyright notice.
         
         6. Chain of Authorship
         
         The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
         hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
         power and authority to grant the Licence.
         
         Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
         brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
         has the power and authority to grant the Licence.
         
         Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
         Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
         terms of this Licence.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty
         
         The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
         Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
         ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.
         
         For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’
         basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
         without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
         of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
         rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.
         
         This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
         condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.
         
         8. Disclaimer of Liability
         
         Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
         persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
         material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the
         use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
         damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
         damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability
         laws as far such laws apply to the Work.
         
         9. Additional agreements
         
         While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional
         agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.
         However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on
         your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
         Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
         Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against
         such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional
         liability.
         
         10. Acceptance of the Licence
         
         The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I
         agree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence
         or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules
         of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable
         acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.
         
         Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
         conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this
         Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work
         or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.
         
         11. Information to the public
         
         In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of
         electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work
         from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a
         website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the
         applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be
         accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.
         
         12. Termination of the Licence
         
         The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
         any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination
         will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from
         the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full
         compliance with the Licence.
         
         13. Miscellaneous
         
         Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
         agreement between the Parties as to the Work.
         
         If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
         law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
         whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it
         valid and enforceable.
         
         The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions
         of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required
         and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the
         Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version
         number.
         
         All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,

FANDANGO is a language-based fuzzer that leverages formal input specifications (grammars) combined with constraints to generate diverse sets of valid inputs for programs under test. Unlike traditional symbolic constraint solvers, FANDANGO uses a search-based approach to systematically evolve a population of inputs through syntactically valid mutations until semantic input constraints are satisfied.

## Introduction

Modern language-based test generators often rely on symbolic constraint solvers to satisfy both syntactic and semantic input constraints. While precise, this approach can be slow and restricts the expressiveness of constraints due to the limitations of solver languages.

FANDANGO introduces a search-based alternative, using genetic algorithms to evolve inputs until they meet the specified constraints. This approach not only enhances efficiency—being one to three orders of magnitude faster in our experiments compared to leading tools like [ISLa](https://github.com/rindPHI/isla/tree/ESEC_FSE_22)—but also allows for the use of the full Python language and libraries in defining constraints.

With FANDANGO, testers gain unprecedented flexibility in shaping test inputs and can state arbitrary goals for test generation. For example:

> "Please produce 1,000 valid test inputs where the ⟨voltage⟩ field follows a Gaussian distribution but never exceeds 20 mV."

## Features

- **Grammar-Based Input Generation**: Define formal grammars to specify the syntactic structure of inputs.
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Use arbitrary Python code to define semantic constraints over grammar elements.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Employ a search-based approach to evolve inputs, improving efficiency over symbolic solvers.
- **Flexible Constraint Language**: Leverage the full power of Python and its libraries in constraints.
- **Performance**: Achieve faster input generation without sacrificing precision.

## Evaluation

FANDANGO has been evaluated against [ISLa](https://github.com/rindPHI/isla/tree/ESEC_FSE_22), a state-of-the-art language-based fuzzer. The results show that FANDANGO is faster and more scalable than ISLa, while maintaining the same level of precision.

To reproduce the evaluation results from ISLa, please refer to [their replication package](https://dl.acm.org/do/10.1145/3554336/full/), published in FSE 2022.
To reproduce the evaluation results from FANDANGO, please checkout to branch `replication-package` and follow the README.md.

Our evaluation showcases FANDANGO's search-based approach as a viable alternative to symbolic solvers, offering the following advantages:

- **Speed**: Faster by one to three orders of magnitude compared to symbolic solvers.
- **Precision**: Maintains precision in satisfying constraints.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large grammars and complex constraints.

FANDANGO is a language-based fuzzer that leverages formal input specifications (grammars) combined with constraints to generate diverse sets of valid inputs for programs under test. Unlike traditional symbolic constraint solvers, FANDANGO uses a search-based approach to systematically evolve a population of inputs through syntactically valid mutations until semantic input constraints are satisfied.

## Introduction

Modern language-based test generators often rely on symbolic constraint solvers to satisfy both syntactic and semantic input constraints. While precise, this approach can be slow and restricts the expressiveness of constraints due to the limitations of solver languages.

FANDANGO introduces a search-based alternative, using genetic algorithms to evolve inputs until they meet the specified constraints. This approach not only enhances efficiency—being one to three orders of magnitude faster in our experiments compared to leading tools like [ISLa](https://github.com/rindPHI/isla/tree/ESEC_FSE_22)—but also allows for the use of the full Python language and libraries in defining constraints.

With FANDANGO, testers gain unprecedented flexibility in shaping test inputs and can state arbitrary goals for test generation. For example:

> "Please produce 1,000 valid test inputs where the ⟨voltage⟩ field follows a Gaussian distribution but never exceeds 20 mV."

## Features

- **Grammar-Based Input Generation**: Define formal grammars to specify the syntactic structure of inputs.
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Use arbitrary Python code to define semantic constraints over grammar elements.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Employ a search-based approach to evolve inputs, improving efficiency over symbolic solvers.
- **Flexible Constraint Language**: Leverage the full power of Python and its libraries in constraints.
- **Performance**: Achieve faster input generation without sacrificing precision.

## Evaluation

FANDANGO has been evaluated against [ISLa](https://github.com/rindPHI/isla/tree/ESEC_FSE_22), a state-of-the-art language-based fuzzer. The results show that FANDANGO is faster and more scalable than ISLa, while maintaining the same level of precision.

To reproduce the evaluation results from ISLa, please refer to [their replication package](https://dl.acm.org/do/10.1145/3554336/full/), published in FSE 2022.
To reproduce the evaluation results from FANDANGO, please checkout to branch `replication-package` and follow the README.md.

Our evaluation showcases FANDANGO's search-based approach as a viable alternative to symbolic solvers, offering the following advantages:

- **Speed**: Faster by one to three orders of magnitude compared to symbolic solvers.
- **Precision**: Maintains precision in satisfying constraints.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large grammars and complex constraints.

Found pyenv, but it is badly configured (pyenv command not found in $PATH). pyenv might not
work correctly for non-interactive shells (for example, when run from a script).

To fix this message, add these lines to the '.profile' and '.zprofile' files
in your home directory:

export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"

You'll need to restart your user session for the changes to take effect.

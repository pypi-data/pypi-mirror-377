```

### 核心原理

1. **文件监控**：使用`watchdog`库监控目录变化，触发文件处理流程
2. **内容提取**：针对不同文件类型使用相应库提取文本（如python-docx处理DOCX）
3. **智能分块**：
  - 按标题、段落等自然分隔符优先分割
  - 保留完整文件路径和块编号元数据
  - 支持重叠分块，避免语义断裂
4. **向量化**：调用OpenAI Embeddings API生成文本向量
5. **存储索引**：使用PostgreSQL+pgvector存储向量并创建IVFFlat索引
6. **向量搜索**：通过余弦相似度计算找到最相关的文件块

## 📦 安装与配置

### 前置要求

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 14+ （需安装pgvector扩展）
- OpenAI API密钥（用于向量化）

### 安装方式

#### 使用pip

```bash
pip install files-vector-mcp-server
```

#### 使用uvx（推荐）

```bash
uvx files-vector-mcp-server
```

### 环境配置

创建`.env`文件，配置以下环境变量：

```ini
# OpenAI配置
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
EMBEDDING_DIM=1024

# 数据库配置
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/vector_db

# 监控目录配置（JSON格式）
WATCH_TOPICS={"docs": ["./docs"], "notes": ["./notes"]}

# 分块配置
CHUNK_SIZE=4000
CHUNK_OVERLAP=200

# 可选：MinerU API配置（高级OCR和文档处理）
MINERU_API_KEY=your_mineru_api_key
MINERU_API_URL=https://mineru.net/api/v4
```

## 💻 使用指南

### 启动服务

```bash
files-vector-mcp-server
```

### 核心工具使用

#### 1. 搜索文件内容

```bash
# 基础搜索（返回摘要）
search "Docker安装步骤"

# 搜索并返回完整内容
search "Docker安装步骤" return_content=true top_k=3
```

**返回结果示例**：

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "chunk_id": 42,
      "file_path": "/docs/install/docker.md",
      "chunk_num": 2,
      "total_chunks": 5,
      "similarity": 0.89,
      "content_preview": "## Docker安装步骤\n\n1. 更新apt包索引...",
      "content": "文件路径: /docs/install/docker.md\n块 2/5\n\n## Docker安装步骤\n\n1. 更新apt包索引...",
      "last_modified": "2025-09-18T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. 读取完整文件

```bash
read_file "/docs/install/docker.md" max_chars=10000
```

#### 3. 创建Markdown文件

```bash
create_markdown "/notes/new_note.md" "# 新笔记\n\n这是通过API创建的笔记内容，将自动进行向量化处理。"
```

## ❓ 常见问题

### Q: 如何处理大型PDF文件？

A: 系统会自动分块处理，默认每块4000字符，可通过`CHUNK_SIZE`调整。对于扫描PDF，建议配置MinerU API启用OCR。

### Q: 服务启动失败提示"pgvector未安装"？

A: 需要在PostgreSQL中安装pgvector扩展：

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

### Q: 如何提高搜索准确性？

A: 可尝试：

- 减小`CHUNK_SIZE`，提高块粒度
- 使用更具体的搜索关键词
- 调整`top_k`参数获取更多结果

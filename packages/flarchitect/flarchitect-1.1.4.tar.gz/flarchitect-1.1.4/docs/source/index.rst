--------------------------------------------


**Build APIs fast, customise at will.**

**flarchitect** turns your `SQLAlchemy`_ models into a polished RESTful API complete with interactive `Redoc`_ or Swagger UI documentation.
Hook it into your `Flask`_ application and you'll have endpoints, schemas and docs in moments. It reduces boilerplate while letting you tailor behaviour to your needs.

What can it do?

* Automatically create CRUD endpoints for your SQLAlchemy models.
* Generate `Redoc`_ or Swagger UI documentation on the fly - no manual OpenAPI spec needed.
* Be configured globally in `Flask`_ or per model or method via ``Meta`` attributes in your models.
* Authenticate users with minimal effort - use JWTs, API keys or Basic Authentication.
* Restrict endpoints to specific roles with :ref:`roles-required`.
* Extend behaviour with response callbacks, custom validators and per-route hooks (:ref:`advanced-extensions`).
* And much more!

Advanced Configuration
----------------------

Need finer control? The :doc:`Advanced Configuration <advanced_configuration>` guide covers features like rate limiting, CORS, and custom cache backends.

Want to see **flarchitect** in action? Define your models, plug the library into your `Flask`_ app, and you'll get CRUD endpoints, schemas, and interactive docs instantly. The :doc:`Quick Start <quickstart>` walks through a complete example.

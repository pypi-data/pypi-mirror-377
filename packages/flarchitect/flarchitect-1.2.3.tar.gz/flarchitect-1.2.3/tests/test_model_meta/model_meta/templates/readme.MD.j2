# Demo API Documentation {{config.VERSION}}

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the Bookstore API.

## 2. Authentication

The LBS Portal API uses json web tokens (JWT) for authentication. The JWT is passed in the Authorization header of each
request. The JWT is generated by the LBS Portal and is valid for {{config.TOKEN_EXPIRY_TIME }} minutes. Once the expiry
has passed the JWT will no longer be valid, and you will need to refresh it. To refresh the JWT you will need to make a
POST request to the /auth/refresh endpoint. The JWT is generated using the HS256 algorithm. Refresh tokens are valid for
{#{{ (config.REFRESH_EXPIRY_TIME / 60 / 24) | int }} Hours. Once the refresh token has expired, you will need to re-login.#}

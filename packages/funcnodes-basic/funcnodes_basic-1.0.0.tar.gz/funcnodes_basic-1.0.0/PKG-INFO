# FuncNodes Basic

## Overview

`funcnodes-basic` is a collection of essential nodes designed to handle fundamental operations in [Funcnodes](https://github.com/linkdlab/funcnodes), such as list manipulation, dictionary operations, logic control, mathematical functions, and string processing. It provides a foundation of commonly needed functionalities in computational graphs built with the FuncNodes framework. Each module within this package contains a set of nodes, grouped by their operation type, allowing seamless integration into broader systems.

## Installation

Install the package with:

```bash
pip install funcnodes-basic
```

## Getting Started

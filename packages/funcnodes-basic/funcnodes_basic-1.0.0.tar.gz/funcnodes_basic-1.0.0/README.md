# FuncNodes Basic

## Overview

`funcnodes-basic` is a collection of essential nodes designed to handle fundamental operations in [Funcnodes](https://github.com/linkdlab/funcnodes), such as list manipulation, dictionary operations, logic control, mathematical functions, and string processing. It provides a foundation of commonly needed functionalities in computational graphs built with the FuncNodes framework. Each module within this package contains a set of nodes, grouped by their operation type, allowing seamless integration into broader systems.

## Installation

Install the package with:

```bash
pip install funcnodes-basic
```

## Getting Started

Please refere to the [Funcnodes](https://github.com/linkdlab/funcnodes) package

## Example Usage

You can integrate the provided nodes in your computational graphs, connecting inputs and outputs between nodes to build complex workflows that utilize dictionaries, lists, logic, math, and string operations.

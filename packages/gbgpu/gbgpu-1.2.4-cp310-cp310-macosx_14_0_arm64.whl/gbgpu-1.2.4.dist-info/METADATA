# gbgpu: GPU/CPU Galactic Binary Waveforms

`GBGPU` is a GPU-accelerated version of the `FastGB` waveform which has been developed by Neil Cornish, Tyson Littenberg, Travis Robson, and Stas Babak. It computes gravitational waveforms for Galactic binary systems observable by LISA using a fast/slow-type decomposition. For more details on the original construction of `FastGB` see [arXiv:0704.1808](https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1808).

The current version of the code is very closely related to the implementation of `FastGB` in the LISA Data Challenges' Python code package. The waveform code is entirely Python-based. It is about 1/2 the speed of the full C version, but much simpler in Python for right now. There are also many additional functions including fast likelihood computations for individual Galactic binaries, as well as fast C-based methods to combine waveforms into global fitting templates. 

The code is CPU/GPU agnostic. CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs are required to run these codes for GPUs.

See the [documentation](https://mikekatz04.github.io/GBGPU/) for more details. This code was designed for [arXiv:2205.03461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03461). If you use any part of this code, please cite [arXiv:2205.03461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03461), its [Zenodo page](https://zenodo.org/records/16999246), [arXiv:0704.1808](https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1808), and [arXiv:1806.00500](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00500). 

## Getting Started

1) Run pip install. This works only for CPU currently. For GPU, see below for installing from source.

```
pip install gbgpu
```

2) To import gbgpu:

```
from gbgpu.gbgpu import GBGPU
```


### Prerequisites

To install this software for CPU usage, you need Python >3.4, and NumPy. We generally recommend installing everything, including gcc and g++ compilers, in the conda environment as is shown in the examples here. This generally helps avoid compilation and linking issues. If you use your own chosen compiler, you may need to add information to the `setup.py` file.

To install this software for use with NVIDIA GPUs (compute capability >5.0), you need the [CUDA toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) and [CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org/). The CUDA toolkit must have cuda version >8.0. Be sure to properly install CuPy within the correct CUDA toolkit version. Make sure the nvcc binary is on `$PATH` or set it as the `CUDAHOME` environment variable.

### Installing

To pip install (only for CPU currently):
```
pip install gbgpu
```

To install from source:

0) [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) if you do not have it.

1) Create a virtual environment. **Note**: There is no available `conda` compiler for Windows. If you want to install for Windows, you will probably need to add libraries and include paths to the `setup.py` file.

```
conda create -n gbgpu_env -c conda-forge gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64 gsl numpy Cython scipy jupyter ipython h5py matplotlib python=3.12 cmake
conda activate gbgpu_env
```

    If on MACOSX, substitute `gcc_linux-64` and `gxx_linus-64` with `clang_osx-64` and `clangxx_osx-64`.

2) If using GPUs, use pip to [install cupy](https://docs-cupy.chainer.org/en/stable/install.html). If you have cuda version 9.2, for example:

```
pip install cupy-cuda92
```

3) Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/mikekatz04/GBGPU.git
cd GBGPU
```

4) Run install. Make sure CUDA is on your PATH.

```
pip install -v -e .
```

## Running the Tests

Change to the testing directory:
```
cd gbgpu/tests
```
Run in the terminal:
```
python -m unittest discover
```

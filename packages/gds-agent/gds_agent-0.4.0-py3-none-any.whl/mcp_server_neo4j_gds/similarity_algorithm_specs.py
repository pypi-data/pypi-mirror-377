        "The algorithm may stop earlier if the neighbor lists only change by a small amount, which can be controlled by the configuration parameter deltaThreshold. "
        "The particular implementation is based on Efficient k-nearest neighbor graph construction for generic similarity measures by Wei Dong et al. "
        "Instead of comparing every node with every other node, the algorithm selects possible neighbors based on the assumption, that the neighbors-of-neighbors of a node are most likely already the nearest one. "
        "The algorithm scales quasi-linear with respect to the node count, instead of being quadratic. "
        "Furthermore, the algorithm only compares a sample of all possible neighbors on each iteration, assuming that eventually all possible neighbors will be seen. "
        "This can be controlled with the configuration parameter sampleRate: A valid sample rate must be in between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive). "
        "The default value is 0.5. The parameter is used to control the trade-off between accuracy and runtime-performance. "
        "A higher sample rate will increase the accuracy of the result. The algorithm will also require more memory and will take longer to compute. "

# Genie-CTL (`geniectl`)

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/geniectl/
Github:

Genie-CTL is a command-line tool that uses Kubernetes-like YAML manifests to declaratively define, generate, and manage complex multimedia assets. It orchestrates calls to various generative APIs, handles dependencies between assets, and ensures that generation is idempotent.

## Vision

The primary goal is to provide a reproducible and version-controllable way to create creative assets like storyboards, videos with soundtracks, illustrated articles, and more.

## Getting Started

See `PLAN.md` for the development roadmap.

To install dependencies:
```bash
just install
```

## Usage

Some examples:

```bash
genectl apply -f etc/sample_story.yaml
```

```bash
$ just plan # Executes a DRY RUN execution
$ just plan
uv run geniectl apply -f /Users/ricc/git/vibecoding/geniectl/etc/story-generation.yaml --plan
Applying from path: /Users/ricc/git/vibecoding/geniectl/etc/story-generation.yaml

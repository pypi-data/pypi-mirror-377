For instance, it supports the non-unitary operations ```DropQubits``` and ```SetDensityMatrix``` as well as post-measurement operations and multiple rounds of measurement. Each round of measurement creates several branches of possible measurement outcomes, all of which are collected in an ensemble. \n",

Different values for the classical bits can be obtained with ```Measure``` or ```SetBits``` in a quantum circuit. If there are no classical bits, then the list of bit values is empty. The value for each key is a pair. The first component of the pair is the probability for obtaining the key and the second component is the corresponding density matrix of the quantum part of the system.\n",

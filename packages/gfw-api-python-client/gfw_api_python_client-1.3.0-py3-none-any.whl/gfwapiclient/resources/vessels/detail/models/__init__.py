"""Global Fishing Watch (GFW) API Python Client - Get Vessel by ID API Models.

This module defines Pydantic models for the Get Vessel by ID API resources.
These models are used to represent request parameters and response data
when retrieving detailed information about a single vessel.

The Get Vessel by ID API allows users to retrieve comprehensive information
about a specific vessel using its unique identifier. This module provides
the data structures necessary for interacting with the API's endpoints.

For detailed information about the Vessels API, including the Get Vessel by ID
endpoint, please refer to the official
`Global Fishing Watch Vessels API Documentation
<https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#get-vessel-by-id>`_."

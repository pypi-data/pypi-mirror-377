"""Global Fishing Watch (GFW) API Python Client - Vessels Search API Models.

This module defines Pydantic models for the Vessels Search API resources.
These models are used to represent request parameters and response data
when searching for vessels based on various criteria.

The Vessels Search API allows users to search for vessels using keywords,
filters, and other parameters. This module provides the data structures
necessary for constructing search queries and parsing search results.

For detailed information about the Vessels Search API, please refer to the
official `Global Fishing Watch Vessels API Documentation
<https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#search>`_.

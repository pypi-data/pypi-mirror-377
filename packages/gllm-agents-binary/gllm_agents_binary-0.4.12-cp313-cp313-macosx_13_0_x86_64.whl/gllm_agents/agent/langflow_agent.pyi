    """Langflow agent implementation for executing Langflow flows.

    This agent integrates with Langflow APIs to execute flows while providing
    full compatibility with the SDK's agent framework, including:
    - Synchronous and asynchronous execution
    - Regular and A2A streaming support
    - Session management for conversation continuity
    - Error handling and retry logic
    - Credential management through BaseAgent

    The agent inherits from BaseAgent to leverage existing A2A infrastructure
    while implementing Langflow-specific execution logic.

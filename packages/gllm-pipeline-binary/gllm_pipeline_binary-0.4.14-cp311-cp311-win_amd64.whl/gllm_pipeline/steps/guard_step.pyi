class GuardStep(ConditionalStep):
    '''A conditional step that can terminate pipeline execution if a condition is not met.

    This step evaluates a condition and either:
    1. Continues execution through the success_branch if the condition is True
    2. Executes the failure_branch and terminates if the condition is False

    Example:
        ```python
        pipeline = (
            step_a
            | GuardStep(
                name="auth_check",

                success_branch=step_b,
                failure_branch=error_handling_step,
            )
            | step_c
        )
        ```

    Attributes:
        name (str): A unique identifier for this pipeline step.
        condition (ConditionType): The condition to evaluate.
        success_branch (BasePipelineStep | list[BasePipelineStep]): Steps to execute if condition is True.
        failure_branch (BasePipelineStep | list[BasePipelineStep] | None): Steps to execute if condition is False.
            If None, pipeline terminates immediately on False condition.
        retry_policy (RetryPolicy | None): Configuration for retry behavior using LangGraph\'s RetryPolicy.

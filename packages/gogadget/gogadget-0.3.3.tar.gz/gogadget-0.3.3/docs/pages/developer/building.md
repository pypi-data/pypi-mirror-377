## Github actions

On every commit, there is a github action that rebuilds the documentation website on each commit.

In addition to the documentation, **on tag commits**, the python wheel will be:

- Built
- Uploaded to PyPi & TestPyPi
- Signed and added to a new Github release

Note that the Windows build is **not** automatically created. This is currently a manual process.

## Manual build

### Required packages

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is used to build the packages and [`Innosetup`](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) is used to build the Windows installer.

### Required binaries (Windows builds only)

The installers use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run the tool in its own virtual environment and the only non-Python runtime dependency is [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org).

### Settings things up

The following assumes building on Windows so that the Windows installer can be created in addition to the multi-platform wheel. If you are building on mac / linux, you can skip steps 3 and 4.

1. Set the version number in [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/jonathanfox5/gogadget/blob/main/pyproject.toml)
2. Set the version number in [install/gogadget_windows.iss](https://github.com/jonathanfox5/gogadget/blob/main/install/gogadget_windows.iss)
3. _[Windows only]_ Make sure that `uv` and `innosetup` are installed and in path. (innosetup isn't by default, you will need to add the root innosetup directory that is located in program files)
4. _[Windows only]_ Download latest windows builds of `ffmpeg` and `uv` and put the binaries directly in [install/bin/](https://github.com/jonathanfox5/gogadget/tree/main/install/bin/)

### Build commands (Windows)

These commands are for Bash on Windows, you will need to convert them to whatever shell / platform you are using.

```sh title="install/windows_build.sh"
--8<-- "install/windows_build.sh"
```

## Documentation

### mkdocs-material

The documentation uses `mkdocs-material` and related plugins. It also uses `typer` to generate [the command reference page](../reference/command_reference.md). The required packages are installed by running:

```sh
uv sync
```

A test server can then be run with:

```sh
uv run mkdocs serve -f docs/mkdocs.yml
```

!!! note "mkdocs errors"

    When running `mkdocs`, if you get an error message that references `cairo`, you will need need to follow [this guide](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/requirements/image-processing/#cairo-graphics) to set it up on your system.

### Generating command reference page

The command reference page can automatically be regenerated with:

```sh
uv run typer gogadget.main utils docs --name gogadget --output docs/pages/reference/command_reference.md
```

!!! note "Manual changes"

    1. From the newly generated [the command reference page](../reference/command_reference.md), I delete the first bit of help text that is shown in the command line version when typing `gogadget`. This is for aesthetic purposes only!
    2. As per [GNU guidance](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html), copyright / license info is then added to top of file.

### Generating list of python dependencies

The list of licenses for python dependencies can be generated with the following. The documentation site automatically references the generated file.

```sh
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
pip-licenses --format=markdown --with-authors --no-version --with-urls --with-system --order=license --output-file=src/gogadget/3rd-party-licences/license_listing_for_python_dependencies.md
```

!!! note "File location"

    `pip-licenses` doesn't have the functionality to output to a specific directory. Therefore, you will need to move it to `src/gogadget/3rd-party-licenses/` manually.

## Running from source

### Generic

Firstly, please note the package requirements at the top of this document. You can then run:

```sh title="install/run_from_source_example.sh"
--8<-- "install/run_from_source_example.sh"
```

### On a clean install of Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS

```sh title="install/linux_test_install.sh"
--8<-- "install/linux_test_install.sh"
```

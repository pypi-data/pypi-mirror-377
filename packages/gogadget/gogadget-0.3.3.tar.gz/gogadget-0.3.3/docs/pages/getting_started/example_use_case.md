## Preparing priming materials

The following example is my personal use case for producing priming materials prior to immersing in them. My target language is Italian (`it`) and my native language is English(`en`). I have downloaded a json dictionary, word audio and an exclude list as described in [Getting dictionary, word audio and exclude lists](../getting_started/getting_resources.md).

## Setting defaults

As a "one off" task, I set up my default settings by running `gogadget set-defaults --custom`. I changed the following settings from the defaults _(the defaults are set for the widest compatibility, not for a specific workflow.)_

```toml
[general]
# Changed language to target language (mine is Italian)
language = "it"
language_for_translations = "en"
output_directory = "."

[external_resources]
# Set the paths of the resources on my hard drive
# Since this is the configuration for my windows pc, I need to replace backslashes with double backslashes to make this a valid file
# gogadget *should* automatically fix it if single backslashes are used but it's best to get it correct to begin with!
word_exclude_spreadsheet = "C:\\languages\\it\\ita_exclude.xlsx"
dictionary_file = "C:\\languages\\it\\it_to_en.json"
word_audio_directory = "C:\\languages\\it\\word_audio"

[anki]
# Changed the `include_words_with_no_definition` to False.
# By filtering out words not in the dictionary, this has the effect of filtering out proper nouns and non-target language words
# The reason why this is not default behaviour is that it would cause Anki decks to have no cards if the user hasn't set a dictionary
extract_media = "True"
include_words_with_no_definition = "False"
subs_offset_ms = "0"
subs_buffer_ms = "50"
max_cards_in_deck = "100"

[lemmatiser]
# Kept the settings in here as default but it might be useful to tweak them for other languages
lemmatise = "True"
filter_out_non_alpha = "True"
filter_out_stop_words = "True"
convert_input_to_lower = "True"
convert_output_to_lower = "True"
return_just_first_word_of_lemma = "True"

[downloader]
# I kept subtitle_language blank as I prefer to generate my own using `gogadget transcribe`
advanced_options = ""
format = ""
subtitle_language = ""

[transcriber]
# I have changed `whisper_use_gpu` to "True" on my windows PC which has an Nvidia GPU. This massively speeds up transcription but it does require a GPU that can run CUDA
whisper_model = "deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2"
alignment_model = ""
subtitle_format = "vtt"
max_subtitle_length = "94"
subtitle_split_threshold = "70"
whisper_use_gpu = "True"
```

Now that these parameters are set, they no longer need to be specified in the commands.

## Running commands

!!! note "A note on commands"

    This example uses the "short" version of the commands. Using the "standard" commands (that are referenced in some other parts of the documentation) is equally valid. More info [here](../getting_started/using_the_tool.md#short-names).

For this example, let's assume that I'm downloading a playlist of videos for a specific series that I want to learn the key vocabulary for. The URL of this hypothetical playlist is `https://www.videosite.com/playlist_name` and I'm storing everything in a folder called `immersion`.

I would then run the following commands. You will notice that many of the parameters no longer need to be entered as they have been covered by the defaults.

1. Download the videos that are in the playlist:

   ```sh
   gogadget download -i "https://www.videosite.com/playlist_name" -o "immersion"
   ```

2. Transcribe the Italian subtitles for all of the videos in the folder. If they were available from the website, I could have just downloaded them in the previous step by specifying a `--subtitle-language` in the command or in the defaults. In general, I prefer the accuracy of transcribing them myself if only auto-generated captions are available.

   ```sh
   gogadget transcribe -i "immersion" -o "immersion"
   ```

3. Create the Anki deck:

   ```sh
   gogadget anki-deck -i "immersion"
   ```

An Anki deck will be written to `immersion/media/`. Double click on the `.apkg` file in that folder and it will automatically be loaded.

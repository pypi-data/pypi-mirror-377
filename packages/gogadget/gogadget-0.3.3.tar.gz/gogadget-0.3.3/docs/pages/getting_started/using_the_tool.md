## Understanding commands

The intended behaviour is that the tool itself should guide the user on how to use it. If you type `gogadget` in a command prompt or terminal window, you will get:

![Main menu](../img/main_menu.png)

The main commands are listed in the `Primary Functions` box and have their own documentation. Each command has parameters associated with it. These can be listed by just typing `gogadget` then the name of the command that you are interested in. For example, `gogadget download` produces:

![Download Help Text](../img/download_help.png)

You will see from the output of that command that you can just run the following to download a video:

```sh
gogadget download --url "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid"
```

Several commands use a standardised two letter code to identify languages (e.g. English is `en`, Italian is `it`, Japanese is `ja`, etc.) To get a list of supported languages and the associated two letter codes, run this command:

```sh
gogadget list-languages
```

Alternatively, you can view the list [here](../getting_started/supported_languages.md).

## Configuration

It's recommended, but not required, that you fully install the models for the languages that you are interested in.

Example: To install Italian (target language) with English (native language) translations, run:

```sh
gogadget install --language it --translation-language en
```

You can also configure defaults so that you don't need to specify as many parameters each time you run your commands:

```sh
gogadget set-defaults --custom
```

An example workflow where defaults are set can be found [here](../getting_started/example_use_case.md).

## Short names

All parameters in all commands have both a "standard" form and a "short" form. You can use whatever works best for you! The following two lines are equivalent.

```sh
gogadget download --url "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid" --output "immersion videos" --subtitle-language en
gogadget download -i "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid" -o "immersion videos" -l en
```

Note: Regardless of the "standard" name, all commands follow the same logic for their "short" names. The item that is being used as input is `-i`, the output is `-o` and the language is `-l`. Normally you don't need any more than this!

# IMPORTANT INFORMATION
# =====================
# - All values are text and should be therefore be wrapped in double quotes. Valid examples:
#       language = "en"
#       lemmatise = "True"
#       lemmatise = "False"
#       subs_offset_ms = "0"
#       subs_offset_ms = "50"
# - If you don't want to a specify a value, just type two double quotes beside each other e.g.:
#       language = ""
#       word_exclude_spreadsheet = ""
# - If you are on Windows, any paths will need to have any backslashes replaces with a double backslash e.g.:
#       word_exclude_spreadsheet = "C:\\data\\exclude.xlsx"
#   Since this is easy to forget about, the tool will try to fix it for you. However, it's always best if it is correct to begin with!
#
# WARNING
# =======
# It is possible to break the tool by setting incorrect values in here.
# However, the script will attempt to fall back to sensible defaults if it can't read your values.
# If your setting appears to not be read by the tool, this is probably the reason!
# Run `gogadget set-defaults --factory` (without quotes) to reset this file if you run into errors or unexplained behaviour

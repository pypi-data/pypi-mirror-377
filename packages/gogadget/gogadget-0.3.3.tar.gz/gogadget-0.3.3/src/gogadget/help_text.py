    # Commands
    main = """
    gogadget is a toolkit for producing immersion and priming tools for language learning. It is capable of downloading audio and video files, automatically transcribing subtitles from videos and podcasts, and automatically producing filtered Anki decks with sentence audio / translations / screenshots / definitions.

    [bright_white i][u]Basics[/u]
    All commands are listed in the "Primary Functions" box below and have their own documentation. Each command has parameters associated with it. These can be listed by just typing [b magenta]gogadget[/] then the name of the command that you are interested in. For example:
    [b magenta]gogadget download[/]

    You will see from the output of that command that you can just run the following to download a video:
    [b magenta]gogadget download --url "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid"[/]

    [u]Advanced[/u]
    Commands have both a "standard" form and a "short" form. You can use whatever works best for you! The following two lines are equivalent.
    [b magenta]gogadget download --url "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid" --output "immersion videos" --subtitle_language en
    gogadget download -i "https://www.videosite.com/watch?v=videoid" -o "immersion videos" -l en[/]
    
    Note: Regardless of the "standard" name, all commands follow the same logic for their "short" names. The item that is being used as input is -i, the output is -o and the language is -l. Normally you don't need any more than this!

    To get a list of supported languages and the associated two letter codes, run this command:
    [b magenta]gogadget list-languages[/]

    [u]Configuration[/u]
    It's recommended, but not required, that you fully install the models for the languages that you are interested in. e.g. To install Italian (target language) with English (native language) translations, run:
    [b magenta]gogadget install --language it --translation-language en[/]

    You can also configure defaults so that you don't need to specify as many parameters each time you run your commands:
    [b magenta]gogadget set-defaults --custom[/][/]
    """
    install = """Download models for a given --language and initialises tools.

    [bright_white i][u]Examples:[/u]
    1. Install modules to process Italian and produce English translations.
    gogadget install --language it --translation-language en

    2. To get a list of language codes to use in the command, run:
    gogadget list-languages
    """
    set_defaults = """
    Configure your default paths so that don't need to specify them each time.
    
    [bright_white i][u]Examples:[/u]

    1. Open the settings file on your folder in your default text editor.
    gogadget set-defaults --custom

    2. Reset to factory defaults.
    gogadget set-defaults --factory

    [red b]~~~~ WARNING ~~~~ It is possible to break the tool by setting incorrect values in the config file.
    Reset to factory defaults if you experience errors or unexpected behaviour.

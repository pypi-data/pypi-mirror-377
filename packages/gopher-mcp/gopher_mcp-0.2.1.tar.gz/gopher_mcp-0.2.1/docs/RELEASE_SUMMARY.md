## üöÄ How to Trigger a Production Release

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Prepare the release
python scripts/prepare-release.py --version 0.2.0

# 2. Create and push the tag
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release version 0.2.0"
git push origin v0.2.0

# 3. Monitor workflow and approve PyPI deployment when prompted
```

### Detailed Process

1. **Preparation Phase**:
   - Update version in `pyproject.toml`
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
   - Run validation: `python scripts/validate-release.py`
   - Commit changes: `git commit -m "chore: prepare release v0.2.0"`

2. **Release Execution**:
   - Create annotated tag: `git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release version 0.2.0"`
   - Push tag: `git push origin v0.2.0`
   - Monitor workflow at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cameronrye/gopher-mcp/actions)

3. **Approval and Verification**:
   - Approve PyPI deployment when prompted
   - Verify GitHub release creation
   - Verify PyPI publication
   - Test installation: `pip install gopher-mcp==0.2.0`

## üîÑ What Happens During the Release Process

### Automatic Steps

1. **Validation Phase** (2-3 minutes):
   - Branch verification (must be `main`)
   - Version format validation
   - Version consistency check (tag vs `pyproject.toml`)
   - Changelog validation

2. **Test and Build Phase** (5-10 minutes):
   - Full test suite execution
   - Security scans (Bandit, Safety)
   - Code quality checks (Ruff, MyPy)
   - Documentation building
   - Package building and validation
   - Package installation testing

3. **GitHub Release Creation** (1-2 minutes):
   - Extract changelog content
   - Generate enhanced release notes
   - Create GitHub release with artifacts
   - Mark as pre-release if applicable

4. **PyPI Publishing** (Manual approval required):
   - **‚è∏Ô∏è Pauses for manual approval**
   - Generate artifact attestation
   - Publish to PyPI with trusted publishing
   - Verify publication success

### Manual Steps Required

- **PyPI Deployment Approval**: Required for production releases
- **Initial PyPI Setup**: One-time trusted publishing configuration

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Safety Features

### Built-in Protections

- **Trusted Publishing**: No API tokens required, uses OIDC
- **Environment Protection**: Manual approval required for PyPI
- **Branch Protection**: Only releases from `main` branch
- **Artifact Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of build provenance
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Multiple checks before publishing
- **Pre-release Support**: Safe testing with pre-release versions

### Rollback Capabilities

- **Tag Deletion**: Can cancel releases by deleting tags
- **PyPI Yanking**: Can yank problematic releases from PyPI
- **Hotfix Process**: Documented procedure for emergency fixes

## üìã Manual Steps and Approvals Required

### One-Time Setup (Required)

1. **PyPI Trusted Publishing Configuration**:
   - Login to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)
   - Navigate to project settings
   - Add trusted publisher with these exact settings:
     ```
     Repository owner: cameronrye
     Repository name: gopher-mcp
     Workflow filename: release.yml
     Environment name: pypi
     ```

2. **TestPyPI Setup** (Optional but recommended):
   - Same process on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/)
   - Use `publish.yml` workflow and `testpypi` environment

### Per-Release Approvals

1. **PyPI Deployment**: Manual approval required in GitHub Actions
2. **Pre-release Review**: Verify all checks pass before approval

## üìä Monitoring and Verification

### What to Monitor

1. **GitHub Actions**: [Workflow runs](https://github.com/cameronrye/gopher-mcp/actions)
2. **GitHub Releases**: [Releases page](https://github.com/cameronrye/gopher-mcp/releases)
3. **PyPI Project**: [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/gopher-mcp/)
4. **Package Installation**: Test with `pip install gopher-mcp==X.Y.Z`

### Success Indicators

- ‚úÖ All workflow steps complete successfully
- ‚úÖ GitHub release created with correct version and notes
- ‚úÖ PyPI shows new version available
- ‚úÖ Package installs and imports correctly
- ‚úÖ CLI command works: `gopher-mcp --help`

## üß™ How to Test Safely

### Recommended Testing Method

Use pre-release versions:

```bash
# Create pre-release
git tag -a v0.2.0-rc.1 -m "Release candidate 0.2.0-rc.1"
git push origin v0.2.0-rc.1

# This will:
# - Run complete workflow
# - Publish to PyPI as pre-release
# - Create GitHub release marked as pre-release
# - Safe for production (users won't install by default)
```

### Alternative Testing

- **TestPyPI**: Use `publish.yml` workflow with manual dispatch
- **Fork Testing**: Test on personal fork with separate PyPI project
- **Local Testing**: Use `scripts/validate-release.py` and `uv build`

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### Cancel a Release

```bash
# Cancel workflow in GitHub Actions
# Delete the tag
git tag -d v0.2.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.0
```

### Rollback a Release

1. **Yank from PyPI**: Use PyPI web interface
2. **Create hotfix**: Prepare patch release (e.g., v0.2.1)
3. **Document issue**: Update changelog and create GitHub issue

## üìö Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Complete PyPI Setup**:
   - Configure trusted publishing on PyPI
   - Test with TestPyPI or pre-release

2. **Test the System**:
   - Create a pre-release to test the complete workflow
   - Verify all steps work as expected

3. **First Production Release**:
   - Follow the release process for version 0.2.0
   - Monitor and document any issues

### Ongoing Maintenance

- **Regular Testing**: Test release process quarterly
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep guides current
- **Security Reviews**: Review configuration annually
- **Process Improvements**: Update based on experience

---

**The release system is now production-ready!** üéâ

All workflows, documentation, and safety measures are in place. The only remaining step is to complete the PyPI trusted publishing configuration and perform the first test release.

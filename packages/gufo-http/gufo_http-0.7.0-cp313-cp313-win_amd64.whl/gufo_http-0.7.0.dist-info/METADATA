*Gufo HTTP* is a high-performance Python HTTP client library that handles both asynchronous and synchronous modes.
It wraps famous [Reqwest][Reqwest] HTTP client, written in
[Rust][Rust] language with [PyO3][PyO3] wrapper.
Our task is to reach maximal performance while maintaining clean and easy-to use API.

The getting of single URL is a simple task:

``` python
async with HttpClient() as client:
    resp = client.get("https://docs.gufolabs.com/")
    assert resp.status == 200
    data = resp.content
```

The `HttpClient` is highly customizable, for example,
to set request headers:

``` python
async with HttpClient(headers={"X-My-Header": b"test"}) as client:
    resp = client.get("https://docs.gufolabs.com/")
    ...
```

The response headers processing as easy as working with dicts:

``` python
async with HttpClient(headers={"X-My-Header": b"test"}) as client:
    resp = client.get("https://docs.gufolabs.com/")
    if resp.headers["Content-Type"] == "text/html":
        ...
```


Gufo HTTP supports common authentication methods out-of-box:

``` python
async with HttpClient(auth=BasicAuth("scott", "tiger")) as client:
    resp = client.get("https://protected.example.com/")
    ...
```

## Features

* Clean async and blocking API.
* High performance (see [Performance](#performance) section for details).
* Built with security in mind.
* Customizabile redirect policy.
* TLS support.
* Basic and bearer authorization schemes.
* HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 Proxy support. 
* Full Python typing support.
* Editor completion.
* Built with security in mind.
* Well-tested, battle-proven code.

## Performance

Gufo HTTP is proved to be one of the fastest Python HTTP client available
in the various scenarios. For example:

### Single HTTP/1.1 requests scenario

*Lower is better*

### 100 Linear HTTP/1.1 requests scenario

![Linear requests](https://docs.gufolabs.com/gufo_http/linear_x100_1k.png)
*Lower is better*

### 100 Parallel HTTP/1.1 requests scenario

![Parallel requests](https://docs.gufolabs.com/gufo_http/p4_x100_1k.png)
*Lower is better*

### Single HTTPS requests scenario

### 100 Linear HTTPS requests scenario

## On Gufo Stack

This product is a part of [Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] - the collaborative effort 
led by [Gufo Labs][Gufo Labs]. Our goal is to create a robust and flexible 
set of tools to create network management software and automate 
routine administration tasks.

To do this, we extract the key technologies that have proven themselves 
in the [NOC][NOC] and bring them as separate packages. Then we work on API,
performance tuning, documentation, and testing. The [NOC][NOC] uses the final result
as the external dependencies.

[Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] makes the [NOC][NOC] better, and this is our primary task. But other products
can benefit from [Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] too. So we believe that our effort will make 
the other network management products better.

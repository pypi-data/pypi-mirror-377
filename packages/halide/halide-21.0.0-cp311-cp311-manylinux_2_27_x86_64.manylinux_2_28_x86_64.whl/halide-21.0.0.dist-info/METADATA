         made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is
         included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix
         below).
         
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
         is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
         annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
         original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative
         Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or
         bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
         version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or

         in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
         of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
         incorporated within the Work.
         
         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
         3. Grant of Patent License.

         of this License; and
         
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
         You changed the files; and
         
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
         distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
         Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
         part of the Derivative Works; and
         
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
         then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of
         the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
         notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
         one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
         the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
         along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
         Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
         The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
         modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative

         additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
         distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
         whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
         complies with the conditions stated in this License.
         
         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

Halide is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
high-performance image and array processing code on modern machines. Halide
currently targets:

- CPU architectures: X86, ARM, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V
- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT
- GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, Apple Metal, Microsoft Direct X 12, Vulkan

Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in
Python. This means you write Python code that builds an in-memory representation
of a Halide pipeline using Halide's Python API. You can then compile this
representation to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same
process.

## Using Halide from C++
Halide is also available as a C++ library. This package provides the development
files necessary to use Halide from C++, including a CMake package. On Linux and
macOS, CMake's `find_package` command should find Halide as long as you're in
the same virtual environment you installed it in. On Windows, you will need to
add the virtual environment root directory to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`. This can be
done by running `set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%VIRTUAL_ENV%` in `cmd`.

Other build systems can find the Halide root path by running `python -c 
"import halide; print(halide.install_dir())"`.

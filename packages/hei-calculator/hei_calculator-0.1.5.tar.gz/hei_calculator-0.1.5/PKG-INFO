# hei-calculator

**hei-calculator** is a Python package that calculates the **Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015)** from dietary intake data stored in CSV files.  
It is designed for **researchers, students, and public health professionals** who want to evaluate diet quality easily.

---

## 📖 What is HEI-2015?

The **Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015)** is a scoring system (0–100 points) that measures how closely a diet follows the **2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans**.  
It includes **13 components** covering fruits, vegetables, proteins, grains, fats, and sugars.  

- **Higher scores** → Better diet quality  
- **Lower scores** → Poorer diet quality

## 📝 Input Requirements

Your CSV file must include these columns:  

- `kcal` → Total energy intake (kcal)  
- `F_TOTAL` → Total fruits  
- `G_WHOLE` → Whole grains  
- `V_TOTAL` → Total vegetables  
- `V_LEGUMES` → Legumes  
- `V_DRKGR` → Dark green vegetables  
- `D_TOTAL` → Total dairy  
- `PF_TOTAL` → Total protein foods  
- `PF_SEAFD_HI` → Seafood (high in n-3 fats)  
- `PF_SEAFD_LOW` → Seafood (low in n-3 fats)  
- `PF_SOY` → Soy products  
- `PF_NUTSDS` → Nuts and seeds  
- `PF_LEGUMES` → Legumes (protein category)  
- `G_REFINED` → Refined grains  
- `ADD_SUGARS` → Added sugars (grams)  
- `SOLID_FATS` → Saturated fats (grams)  
- `Sodium` / `SODIUM` / `NA` / `sodium` → Sodium (mg)

## 📊 Output

The package calculates **13 HEI-2015 component scores** and one **total score**:

1. HEI_total_fruits  
2. HEI_whole_fruits  
3. HEI_total_veg  
4. HEI_green_and_beans  
5. HEI_whole_grains  
6. HEI_total_dairy  
7. HEI_total_protein  
8. HEI_sea_food  
9. HEI_fatty_acids  
10. HEI_refined_grains  
11. HEI_sodium  
12. HEI_added_sugar  
13. HEI_saturated_fat  

➡️ **HEI_total** = Sum of all 13 components  

The results are saved in a **new CSV file** with these additional columns.

# AGENTS.md for hep-data-llm package

This is a proof of principle package for LLM's that can code up particle physics plots and other tasks.

## Dev environment tips

- Run `pip install -e .[test]` to get everything properly installed for testing and development.
- Package uses `hatch` to build the package.
- Use `typer` for the CLI. Commands and sub commands are encouraged.
- Use `pydantic` objects where it makes sense (reading config from files, etc.).
- We are coding for python 3.13 and above. No need for things like `annotations`.

## Testing instructions

- Use `pytest` to test all tests, and `pytest --no-docker` if in an environment without docker.
- Use `pytest` fixtures when needed, including ones like `tmp_path` to keep tests clean.
- When adding new code make sure it is tested.
- Tests are located under the `tests` directory, and each source file's test can be found in `test_<source-file>.py`. Always put new unit tests in the corresponding file of the code file you are testing.
- Make sure `black .` runs on all new code without changing it (e.g. `black` formatting rules). You can ignore any errors in notebooks.
- Make sure `flake8 src/` and `flake8 tests/` also run. Line length is 99.

## Introduction

This repo contains the code used to translate english queries for plots into the actual plots using LLM's and python packages and tools like ServiceX, Awkward, Vector, and hist.

Benchmark studies with the 8 adl-index as presented in conferences can be found in the [results](results/) directory.

Use `--help` at the root level and on commands (e.g. `hep-data-llm plot --help`) to get a complete list of options.

## Installation

To run out of the box you'll need to do the following once:

__Prerequisites__:

1. You'll need to have `docker` installed on your machine
1. Build the `docker` image that is used to run `servicex`, `awkward`, and friends: `docker build -t atlasplotagent:latest Docker`
1. If you are running a `servicex` workflow, [get an access token](https://servicex-frontend.readthedocs.io/en/stable/connect_servicex.html). Make sure the `servicex.yaml` file is either in your home directory or your current working directory.
1. You'll need token(s) to access the LLM. Here is what the `.env` looks like. Please create this either in your local directory or your home directory. Make sure only you can read it: this is access to a paid service!

```text
api_openai_com_API_KEY=<openai-key>
api_together_xyz_API_KEY=<together.ai key>
openrouter_ai_API_KEY=<openrouter-key>
```

### Running in a local python environment

```console
pip install hep-data-llm
hep-data-llm plot "Plot the ETmiss of all events in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.801167.Py8EG_A14NNPDF23LO_jj_JZ2.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_e8528_a911_s4114_r15224_r15225_p6697." output.md
```

The output will be in `output.md` - view in a markdown rendering problem (I use `vscode`). A `img` directory will be created and it will contain the plot (hopefully).

Use `hep-data-llm plot --help` to see all the options you can give it. It defaults to using `gpt-5`, the most successful model in tests.

### Default questions

A `questions.yaml` file is bundled with the package containing a list of common plotting questions. To run one of these questions by number, pass the index (starting from 1) instead of the full text:

```console
hep-data-llm plot 1 output.md
```

This will execute the first question from `questions.yaml`.

### Running with `uvx`

This is great if you want to just run once or twice.

```console
uvx hep-data-llm plot "Plot the ETmiss of all events in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.801167.Py8EG_A14NNPDF23LO_jj_JZ2.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_e8528_a911_s4114_r15224_r15225_p6697." output.md
```

This uses the `uvx` tool to install a temporary environment. If you want to keep this around to use, you can use `uv tool install hep-data-llm`. Do remember to update it every now and then!

## Usage

### new profile

Use the `new profile <filename>" to create a new profile. It copies the default profile, and you can then modify it and update it with new prompt or other items.

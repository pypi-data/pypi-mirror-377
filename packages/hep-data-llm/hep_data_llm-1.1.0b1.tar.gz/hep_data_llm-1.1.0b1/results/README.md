# Benchmark Questions

The raw data in this folder was used for two talks that were given:

* [LLMs for Physics Software](https://www.munich-iapbp.de/activities/activities-2025/machine-learning/schedule) at the [Go Big or Get Smart](https://www.munich-iapbp.de/activities/activities-2025/machine-learning) workshop
* [ACAT 2025: Using Large Language Models to Accelerate Access To Physics](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1488410/contributions/6562829/)

Results:

* [`direct-query`](./direct-query/) has results for plotting all 8 adl-index questions. The hints and questions were all given to the LLM at once.
* [`plan-query`](./plan-query/) has the results for plotting all 8 adl-index questions. A plan is first developed, and then the code is developed in stages.

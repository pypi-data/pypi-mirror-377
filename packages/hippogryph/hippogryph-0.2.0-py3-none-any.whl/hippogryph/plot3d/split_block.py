    """Split blocks is used to divide an array of blocks based on number of cells per block. This code maintains the greatest common denominator of the parent block. Number of cells per block is simply an estimate of how many you want. The actual number will change to meet the greatest common denominator (GCD). GCD of 4 means multigrid of 3 e.g. grid/4 (coarse), 2 (fine), and 1 (finest). If a direction is not specified then for each block the longest index either i,j, or k is used. 
    

        Wisdom from Dave Rigby:
            For example, for radial equilibrium we must integrate across the span.  Some codes (GlennHT used to) would want a single block across the entire span.  In that case you would want some additional control.
 
            Another example might be if you would like a block to include the entire boundary layer.  In that case you might introduce an aspect ratio control.

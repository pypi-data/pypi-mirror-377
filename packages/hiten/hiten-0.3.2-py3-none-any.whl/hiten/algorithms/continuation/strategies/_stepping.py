"""Provide concrete implementations of continuation stepping strategies.

This module provides concrete implementations of stepping strategies used in
continuation algorithms. These strategies handle the prediction phase of the
continuation process, generating numerical representations of the next solution
based on the current solution and step size.

The module includes both simple natural parameter stepping and
pseudo-arclength stepping with tangent vector maintenance for navigating
complex solution branches.

All numerical computations use nondimensional units appropriate for the specific
dynamical system being studied.

class _StepStrategy(Protocol):
    """Define an extended protocol for stepping strategies with event hooks.

    This protocol extends the basic stepping interface with event hooks
    that allow strategies to respond to various continuation events.
    This enables sophisticated stepping strategies that maintain internal
    state and adapt their behavior based on continuation progress.

    The protocol supports strategies that need to:
    - Track solution history for improved predictions
    - Adapt step sizes based on convergence behavior
    - Maintain auxiliary data structures (e.g., tangent vectors)
    - Respond to continuation events for internal bookkeeping

    Notes
    -----
    All hook methods are optional and can be implemented as no-ops.
    The hooks provide extension points for strategies that need to
    maintain state or adapt behavior based on continuation events.

    Common uses for hooks include:
    - Updating solution history for secant methods
    - Computing tangent vectors for pseudo-arclength continuation
    - Adapting step sizes based on convergence rates
    - Logging or debugging continuation progress

    This class implements a simple stepping strategy for natural parameter

    continuation scenarios without complex step adaptation requirements.

    All domain-specific logic (state component selection, amplitude
    manipulations, parameter scaling, etc.) is encapsulated in the
    predictor function, keeping the stepping strategy generic and reusable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    predictor : callable
        Function that generates solution predictions. Should have signature:
        ``predictor(solution: object, step: ndarray) -> ndarray``
        Returns numerical representation of the predicted next solution.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation provides:
    
    - **Simple delegation**: All prediction logic in user function
    - **No step adaptation**: Step sizes remain unchanged
    - **Stateless operation**: No internal state maintenance
    - **No-op hooks**: All event hooks are empty implementations
    
    The strategy is most suitable for:
    - Natural parameter continuation with simple prediction
    - Cases where step adaptation is handled by the continuation engine
    - Domain-specific prediction logic that doesn't need strategy state
    - Rapid prototyping and simple continuation scenarios

    This class implements a sophisticated stepping strategy that maintains
    solution history and computes tangent vectors for pseudo-arclength

    that would cause simpler stepping strategies to fail.

    The strategy uses the secant method to estimate tangent vectors from
    solution history, enabling prediction along solution curves in the
    extended parameter-solution space characteristic of pseudo-arclength
    continuation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    representation_fn : callable
        Function that converts solution objects to numerical representations.
        Should have signature: ``representation_fn(solution: object) -> ndarray``

    parameter_fn : callable
        Function that extracts continuation parameters from solution objects.
        Should have signature: ``parameter_fn(solution: object) -> ndarray``
        Used for parameter space components of tangent vectors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _repr_hist : list of ndarray
        History of solution representations for tangent computation.
    _param_hist : list of ndarray
        History of parameter values for tangent computation.
    _tangent : ndarray or None
        Current normalized tangent vector in extended space, or None
        if insufficient history for tangent computation.

    Notes
    -----
    The stepping strategy implements:
    
    1. **History maintenance**: Tracks solution and parameter history
    2. **Tangent computation**: Uses secant method for tangent estimation
    3. **Fallback prediction**: Natural parameter step when tangent unavailable
    4. **Extended space**: Operates in combined solution-parameter space
    
    The tangent vector is computed in the extended space containing both
    solution representation and continuation parameters, enabling the
    pseudo-arclength method to navigate complex solution branches.

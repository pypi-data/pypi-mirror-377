"""Define step-size control interfaces for Newton-type correction algorithms.

This module provides abstract interfaces and concrete implementations for
step-size control strategies used in Newton-type iterative methods. These
interfaces enable different stepping strategies (plain Newton steps, line
search methods, trust region approaches) to be used interchangeably within
correction algorithms.

The module implements a protocol-based design that separates the step
computation logic from the overall Newton iteration framework, allowing
for flexible combinations of different stepping strategies with various
correction algorithms.

class _Stepper(Protocol):
    """Define the protocol for step transformation functions in Newton-type methods.

    This protocol defines the interface for functions that transform a
    computed Newton step into an accepted update. Different implementations
    can provide various step-size control strategies, from simple full
    steps to sophisticated line search and trust region methods.

    The protocol enables separation of concerns between:
    - Newton step computation (direction finding)
    - Step size control (distance along direction)
    - Convergence monitoring (residual evaluation)

    Implementations typically handle:
    - Step size scaling for convergence control
    - Safeguards against excessive step sizes
    - Line search for sufficient decrease conditions
    - Trust region constraints for robustness

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Current iterate in the Newton method.
    delta : ndarray
        Newton step direction (typically from solving J*delta = -F).
    current_norm : float
        Norm of the residual at the current iterate *x*.

    Returns
    -------
    x_new : ndarray
        Updated iterate after applying the step transformation.
    r_norm_new : float
        Norm of the residual at the new iterate *x_new*.
    alpha_used : float
        Step-size scaling factor actually employed. A value of 1.0
        indicates the full Newton step was taken, while smaller values
        indicate step size reduction for convergence control.

    Notes
    -----
    The protocol allows for flexible step-size control strategies:
    
    - **Full Newton steps**: alpha_used = 1.0, x_new = x + delta
    - **Scaled steps**: alpha_used < 1.0, x_new = x + alpha * delta
    - **Line search**: alpha chosen to satisfy decrease conditions
    - **Trust region**: delta modified to stay within trust region
    
    Implementations should ensure that r_norm_new is computed consistently
    with the norm function used in the overall Newton algorithm.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Simple full-step implementation
    >>> def full_step(x, delta, current_norm):
    ...     x_new = x + delta
    ...     r_norm_new = norm_fn(residual_fn(x_new))
    ...     return x_new, r_norm_new, 1.0
    >>>
    >>> # Scaled step implementation
    >>> def scaled_step(x, delta, current_norm):

    This class provides the foundation for implementing different step-size

    The interface follows the strategy pattern, allowing correction algorithms
    to be parameterized with different stepping behaviors without changing
    their core logic. This enables flexible combinations of:

    - Different Newton variants (standard, damped, quasi-Newton)
    - Different step control strategies (full steps, line search, trust region)
    - Different problem-specific constraints and safeguards

    Subclasses must implement the step transformation logic while this base
    class handles common initialization patterns and ensures compatibility
    with multiple inheritance chains commonly used in the correction framework.

    Parameters
    ----------
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments passed to parent classes.
        This enables clean cooperation in multiple-inheritance chains.

    -----
    The interface is designed to work seamlessly with multiple inheritance,

    This class extends the plain step interface with optional Armijo line
    search capabilities. It provides a more robust stepping strategy that

    nonlinear systems where full Newton steps might diverge.

    The interface supports both plain Newton steps (for efficiency) and
    Armijo line search (for robustness), with the choice determined by
    configuration. This flexibility allows algorithms to adapt their
    stepping strategy based on problem characteristics or user preferences.

    Features:
    - Optional Armijo line search with backtracking
    - Configurable line search parameters
    - Fallback to plain Newton steps when line search is disabled
    - Automatic sufficient decrease condition checking
    - Robust convergence for challenging problems

    The Armijo line search ensures sufficient decrease in the residual norm,
    providing theoretical convergence guarantees under appropriate conditions.

    - Poorly conditioned nonlinear systems
    - Problems with bad initial guesses

    Parameters
    ----------
    line_search_config : _LineSearchConfig, bool, or None, optional
        Line search configuration. Can be:
        - None: Disable line search (use plain Newton steps)
        - True: Enable line search with default parameters
        - False: Explicitly disable line search
        - _LineSearchConfig: Enable line search with custom parameters
    **kwargs
        Additional arguments passed to parent classes.

    Notes
    -----
    The interface inherits plain Newton step capabilities from its parent
    class, ensuring that it can fall back to simple stepping when line
    search is not needed or fails to improve convergence.

    The Armijo condition requires that the residual norm decrease by a
    sufficient amount proportional to the step size, providing a balance

# 🐟🐍 HODOR Python API

**A Python package for programmatic access, download, and analysis of the [HODOR dataset](https://github.com/TAWilts/HODOR).**

---

## About the HODOR Dataset

HODOR (Hydroacoustic and Optical Dataset for Oceanic Research) is a large, open-access dataset of synchronized underwater stereo video and sonar recordings, with detailed animal activity counts. The main HODOR data repository and documentation are available at: [https://github.com/TAWilts/HODOR](https://github.com/TAWilts/HODOR)

This package provides a convenient Python interface to access, download, and analyze HODOR data. It is installable via PyPI and designed for easy integration with pandas and scientific workflows.

---

## Features

- Download HODOR activity counts, stereo video, and sonar data by sequence ID
- Filter and analyze metadata and animal activity using pandas DataFrames
- Download only the data you need (safe, repeatable, skips files already present)
- Enum-based filtering for species
- Simple API for targeted or bulk downloads

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install hodor-python
```

---

## Quickstart

```python
from hodor_python import HODOR_Dataset, Species

# Set a local folder for data storage
hodor = HODOR_Dataset(dataset_folder="/path/to/hodor_data")

# Access activity counts as a pandas DataFrame
df = dataset.counts

# Filter for sequences with high cod activity
cod_sequences = df[df[Species.FISH_COD] > 0]

# Download video and sonar for a specific sequence
hodor.download_sequence(1)
```

## API Overview

### `HODOR_Dataset`

- `HODOR_Dataset(dataset_folder: str)` – Main entry point. Manages local cache and access.
- `.counts` – Returns a pandas DataFrame with sequence metadata and activity counts.
- `.download_video(sequence_ids)` – Download stereo video for one or more sequence IDs.
- `.download_sonar(sequence_ids)` – Download sonar data for one or more sequence IDs.
- `.download_sequence(sequence_ids)` – Download both video and sonar for one or more sequence IDs.

### `Species` Enum

Use for filtering DataFrame columns by species (e.g., `Species.FISH_COD`).

## More Information

- Main HODOR data repository: [https://github.com/TAWilts/HODOR](https://github.com/TAWilts/HODOR)
- Data is hosted on [PANGAEA](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.980000), with DOIs for each subset.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 integration)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HospitalSim.git
   cd HospitalSim
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Hospital Simulation

```python
from hospital_sim.main import HospitalSimulation

# Initialize hospital
hospital = HospitalSimulation(hospital_name="General Hospital")

# Generate sample patients
hospital.generate_patients(num_patients=5)

# Run simulation
hospital.run_simulation(
    duration_minutes=60,
    patient_arrival_rate=0.1
)
```

### Single Patient Processing

```python
# Process individual patient
patient_record = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 45,
    "gender": "Male",
    "chief_complaint": "Chest pain",
    "symptoms": ["chest pain", "shortness of breath"],
    "medical_history": ["hypertension"],
    "current_medications": ["lisinopril"],
    "allergies": ["penicillin"]
}

result = hospital.run(patient_record)
print(f"Treatment completed: {result['status']}")
print(f"Diagnosis: {result['diagnosis']}")
print(f"Treatment time: {result['total_time_minutes']:.1f} minutes")
```

### EHR System Integration

```python
# Query patient history
history = hospital.ehr_system.query_patient_history(
    patient_id="patient_123",
    query="chest pain symptoms"
)

# Search similar cases
similar_cases = hospital.ehr_system.search_similar_cases(
    symptoms=["chest pain", "shortness of breath"],
    diagnosis="myocardial infarction"
)
```

Coca is a first-of-its-kind async-first framework for building fully modern Python terminal and CLI applications. Its use of typehints to facilitate complex runtime reflection-based behaviors, multi-file CLI apps, decoupled state and rendering layers, and component-driven architecture make it easy to give your programs both pizzaz and rich functionality while remaining efficient.

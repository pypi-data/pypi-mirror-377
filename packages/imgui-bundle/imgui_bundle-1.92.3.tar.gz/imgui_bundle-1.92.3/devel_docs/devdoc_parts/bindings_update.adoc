[[bindings_update]]
=== Update existing bindings

The process for updating bindings for a given library is straightforward:

1. Update the library submodule in external/LIBNAME/LIBNAME
2. Run the generation script in external/LIBNAME/generate_LIBNAME.py
3. Compile and test python bindings
(carefully study that nothing was broken)
4. Commit and push

For example with ImCoolBar, in order to update the bindings for ImCoolBar, one needs to run:

[source,bash]
----
python external/ImCoolBar/bindings/generate_imcoolbar.py
----
(See <<bindings_intro>>)

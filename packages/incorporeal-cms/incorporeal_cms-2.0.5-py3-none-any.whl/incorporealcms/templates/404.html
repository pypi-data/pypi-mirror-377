    <h1>NOT FOUND</h1>
    <p>Sorry, the file you requested does not seem to exist, at least not anymore.</p>
    <p>It's possible you followed a dead link on this site, in which case I would appreciate it if you could email me at
    {{ config.CONTACT_EMAIL }} and I can take a look. I make an effort to symlink old content to its new location,
    so old links and URLs should, generally speaking, work.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, I suggest you go <a href="/">to the index</a> and navigate your way (hopefully) to what
    you're looking for.</p>

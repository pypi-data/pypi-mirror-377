    Invoicetronic API

    The [Invoicetronic API][2] is a RESTful service that allows you to send and receive invoices through the Italian [Servizio di Interscambio (SDI)][1], or Interchange Service. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use, abstracting away SDI complexity while providing complete control over the invoice send/receive process. It provides advanced features as encryption at rest, multi-language pre-flight invoice validation, multiple upload formats, webhooks, event logging, client SDKs, and CLI tools.

issues:
  - |
    The response headers for empty body HTTP 204 replies, at present, violate
    RFC7230. This was not intentional, but underlying libraries also
    make inappropriate changes to the headers, which can cause clients to
    experience odd failures. This is anticipated to be corrected once an
    underlying issue in
    `eventlet <https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/746>`_ is resolved.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes HTTP responses so the Eventlet library, which is used to support
    the operation of the WSGI application, does not incorrectly inject
    a ``Transfer-Encoding`` header into the HTTP response, even on HTTP 204
    replies, which is a violation of RFC7230. This header ultimately can
    cause varying client reactions which are not expected and can raise
    exceptions. For now, this has been remedied via an explicit return of
    a ``Content-Length`` header, which is also an RFC7230 violation, but
    it appears to be the lesser of known evils at this time.

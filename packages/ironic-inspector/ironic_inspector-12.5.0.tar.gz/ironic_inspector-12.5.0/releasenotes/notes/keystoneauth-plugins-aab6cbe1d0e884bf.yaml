features:
  - Ironic-Inspector is now using keystoneauth and proper auth_plugins
    instead of keystoneclient for communicating with Ironic and Swift.
    It allows to finely tune authentication for each service independently.
    For each service, the keystone session is created and reused, minimizing
    the number of authentication requests to Keystone.
upgrade:
  - Operators are advised to specify a proper keystoneauth plugin
    and its appropriate settings in [ironic] and [swift] config sections.
    Backward compatibility with previous authentication options is included.
    Using authentication information for Ironic and Swift from
    [keystone_authtoken] config section is no longer supported.
deprecations:
  - Most of current authentication options for either Ironic or Swift are
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please configure
    the keystoneauth auth plugin authentication instead.

    The legacy Role Based Access Control policy used by ironic-inspector has
    been disabled by default. The end result of this is that the legacy
    ``baremetal_admin`` and ``baremetal_observer`` roles are no longer enabled
    by default. System scoped access can be utilized to connect to the
    ``ironic-inspector`` service, or alternatively a user with an ``admin``
    or ``service`` role.

    The Ironic project does not anticipate any issues with this change, as the
    the ``ironic-inspector`` service is a service *for* the system itself.
    That being said, if the operator deployed configuration is reliant upon
    the deprecated roles, configuration changes will be required.

    This change is a result of the new policy which was introduced as part of
    `Consistent and Secure RBAC`_ community goal and the underlying
    ``[oslo_policy] enforce_scope`` and ``[oslo_policy] enforce_new_defaults``
    settings being changed to ``True``.

    Operators wishing to revert to the old policy configuration may do so
    by setting the following values in ``ironic-inspector.conf``.::

      [oslo_policy]
      enforce_new_defaults=False
      enforce_scope=False

    Operators who revert the configuration are encouraged to make the
    necessary changes to their configuration, as the legacy RBAC policy
    will be removed at some point in the future. Please review
    `2024.1-Release Timeline`_. Failure to do so will may force operators
    to craft custom policy override configuration.

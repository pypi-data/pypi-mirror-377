deprecations:
  - |
    The ironic-inspector project is now in maintenance mode and will only
    receive bug fixes and other minor improvements from now on. The same
    functionality is being added to ironic itself. The preview of it is
    expected to be available in the Caracal release cycle, ironic-inspector
    will be deprecated afterwards.

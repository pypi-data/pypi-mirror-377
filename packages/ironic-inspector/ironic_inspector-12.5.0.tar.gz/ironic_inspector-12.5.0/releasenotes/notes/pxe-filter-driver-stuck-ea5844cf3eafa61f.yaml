    Inspector now ignores failures to list ironic ports during
    pxe filter driver sync, and just skips the sync in this case.
    Previously such errors resulted in pxe filter driver being stuck
    in an uninitialized state until ironic inspector was restarted.
    See bug `2008971 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008971>`_.

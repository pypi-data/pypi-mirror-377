    Fixes issues in Inspector where various tasks would not have retry logic
    applied to them and may sporadically fail. This is because the OpenStack
    SDK does not comprehend the NodeLocked error, which previously
    python-ironicclient silently handled. Basic operations such as
    "power reboot" and "set boot device" will now be retried automatically if
    they fail.

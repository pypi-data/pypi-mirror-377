    Fixes the Role Based Access Control state and capabilities to align with
    OpenStack Community RBAC goals which includes support for a ``service``
    role by default to enable inter-service communication to be configured
    without an ``admin`` username. In large part, these changes were missed
    as the Inspector service is considered an "admin-only" service.

    Also in alignment with overall community position changes, where the
    ``admin`` role is sufficient without an explicit ``system`` scope. To
    help ensure a high level of security, explicit testing was also added
    for the ``manager`` role, which is unavailable as that role is reserved
    for administrative functions inside of a tenant's project.

upgrade:
  - |
    The rootwrap rule to allow restarting the systemd service
    openstack-ironic-inspector-dnsmasq.service has been removed. No known
    tooling requires this rule since before Train. Any configuration tool which
    is setting [dnsmasq_pxe_filter]dnsmasq_start_command also needs to be
    writing an appropriate rootwrap.d file, as the inspector devstack plugin
    does.

    supported. Please upgrade to an intermediate release prior to upgrading
    to this release.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue where database responses of nodes would get orphaned
    in inspector process RAM, and would not be garbage collected.
    We were able to discover and reproduce this issue while working on
    database connectivity locks remaining in place.
    Please see `story 2009727 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009727>`_
    for more details.
deprecations:
  - |
    Plugin maintainers should be aware that the Node Cache object field
    ``version_id`` filed is no longer in use. It is still returned
    by the data model if stored for the purposes of compatibility, but
    Inspector will not update the field through the normal course of it's
    operation.
other:
  - |
    Plugin maintainers who are directly working with the database will
    need to update their plugins. Specifically the Database API has
    been delineated into using ``enginefacade`` with a dedicated
    reader and writer model, in anticipation of support for SQLAlchemy 2.0
    and an eventual merge of Inspector into Ironic at some point in the
    future. Database actions are now performed through the
    ``ironic_inspector.db.api`` module, where previously they were spread
    across ``ironic_inspector.db`` and ``ironic_inspector.node_cache``.

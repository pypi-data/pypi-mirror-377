<!-- Not always needed, but a scope helps the user understand in a short sentance like below, why this repo exists -->
## Scope

The tool analyzes Javacores and verbose gc logs and provides some reports like cpu/gc usage, blocked threads, some tips regarding the javacores. The tool can process the following data:
* Set of Javacores from the same run. Optionally you can add verbose.gc log file
* Single Javacore

  
<!-- A more detailed Usage or detailed explaination of the repository here -->
## Installation and usage

### Installation:
The tool requires Python 3.9 or higher plus some packages - see more in [REQUIREMENTS](REQUIREMENTS.md). 
Despite it is not mandatory, it is recommended in Python to use virtual environment to manage packages.

#### Installing from pip
This is most common option which you will need in 99% of situations  

Steps:
1. Download and install Python. Usually the latest version is supported. Search for supported versions in 
[REQUIREMENTS](REQUIREMENTS.md)
2. Create and activate Virtual Environment according to [Creating virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).
3. Run the following command:
   `pip install javacore-analyser`  
    OR
   `pip install --pre javacore-analyser` - if you want an experimental version


#### Installing from sources
This is recommended for geeks only:
1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 from above
2. Download the project files either from [Releases](https://github.com/IBM/javacore-analyser/releases) or from [main](https://github.com/IBM/javacore-analyser/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Extract the code and from code directory execute
   `pip install .`

### Running the tool:

#### Running cmd application: 
1. Install application if not done yet
2. Activate your created virtual environment according to activate Virtual Environment according to [Creating virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments)
3. Run the following command from cmd:  
`javacore-analyser-batch <input-data> <generated-reports-dir>`  
or  
`python -m javacore_analyser batch <input-data> <generated-reports-dir>`  

Where `<input-data>` is one of the following:
* The directory containing javacores and optionally verbose gc
* Archive (7z, zip, tar.gz, tar.bz2) containing the same
* List of the javacores separated by `;` character. Optionally you can add `--separator` option to define your own separator.
* You can specify `--skip_boring=False` if you want drill-down pages generated for all the threads, including the ones that do not do anything interesting.
You can type the following command to obtain the help:  
`javacore-analyser-batch --help` or `python -m javacore_analyser batch --help`

#### Running web application:
1. Repeat steps 1-3 from cmd application
2. Execute the following command from cmd:  
  `javacore_analyser_web --port=5000 --reports-dir=/data/reports_dir`  
     or  
  `python -m javacore_analyser web --port=5000 --reports-dir=/data/reports_dir`  


   The first parameter set the port to use by application. If not specified, 5000 will be used.  
   The second parameter sets where the reports need to be stored. If not set, then the `reports` dir will be created in current location.  

Now you can type (http://localhost:5000/).  

### Running container image
There is a Docker/Podman container managed by one of projects developers. Use the following command 
to start it:

`podman run -it --rm --name javacore-analyser --mount type=bind,src="/local-reports-dir",target=/reports -p 5001:5000 ghcr.io/ibm/javacore-analyser:latest`

or  
`docker run -it --rm --name javacore-analyser --mount type=bind,src="/local-reports-dir",target=/reports -p 5001:5000 ghcr.io/ibm/javacore-analyser:latest`  

The `mount` option specifies where you want locally to store the reports. The reports in the container are stored in 
`/reports` directory. If you remove mount option, the application will work but the reports will not persist after 
restart.  
The application is running in the container on port 5000. By using `-p 5001:5000` option, you specify to map container 
port 5000 to port 5001 on your machine. Therefore the application will be available under `http://localhost:5001/`.

NOTE: If you get a `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/reports/wait2-debug.log'` message,
try specifying a different folder as the `src` parameter value or use the
[--volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) option instead of `--mount`. Find more on 
[Issue #140](https://github.com/IBM/javacore-analyser/issues/140#issuecomment-2757809160).


### Running collectors
There is a collector available that will gather javacores, verbose gc and some further server configuration (`ulimit`, `ps`, memory and disk usage) for Linux systems.
Perform the following steps to run the tool:
1. Download the collector from [javacoreCollector.sh](collectors/javacoreCollector.sh) to the machine where you want to gather data. 
2. Execute it with the following command:

`./javacoreCollector.sh libertyPath=/opt/ibm/liberty server=liberty_server_name` - for collecting diagnostic data from a java application running on an IBM WebSphere Liberty profile,

or

`./javacoreCollector.sh javaPid=12345 javacoresDir=/location/for/javacores` - for collecting diagnostic data from any java aplication.


You can add the 'count' and 'interval' parameters to specify the number of javacores (default: 10) and interval between each of them (defaul: 30s).

Type `./javacoreCollector.sh` to get more help.

After collection, the collector creates `javacores.tar.gz` file containing the following data:
* javacore files, 
* Verbose gc files, if found in `javacoresDir` or `libertyPath` location, 
* Ulimit settings in `ulimit.txt` file,
* output from `ps`, memory and disk usage it iteration files. This data is gathered periodically with the same interval as javacores. There is separate file created for each collection.

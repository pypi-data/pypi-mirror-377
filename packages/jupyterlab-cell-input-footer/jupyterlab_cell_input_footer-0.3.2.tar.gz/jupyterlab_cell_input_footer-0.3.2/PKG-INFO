# JupyterLab Extension - cell input footer

[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/jupyter-ai-contrib/jupyterlab-cell-input-footer/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jupyter-ai-contrib/jupyterlab-cell-input-footer/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A JupyterLab extension that adds a footer to cell inputs.

JupyterLab core ships with a cell footer; however, this footer is located _after_ the cell output. I needed a footer underneath the cell _input_. This plugin offers the API I needed to add UX underneath the cell input.

## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0

## Install

To install the extension, execute:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab_cell_input_footer
```

## Uninstall

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab_cell_input_footer
```

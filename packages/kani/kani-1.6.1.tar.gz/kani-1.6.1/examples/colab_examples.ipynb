      "AI: The Yamanote Line is a major railway loop line in Tokyo, Japan, and it is operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East). The line is one of Tokyo's busiest and connects most of Tokyo's major stations and urban centres, with all but two of its 30 stations connecting to other railway or underground lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trains on the Yamanote Line run from 04:26 to 01:04 the following day at intervals as short as 2 minutes during peak periods. A complete loop takes about 59 to 65 minutes, and all trains stop at every station.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yamanote Line significantly contributes to Tokyo's public transport due to its central location and the connection to most of Tokyo's major commuter hubs and commercial areas. As of 2018, the ridership intensity of the Yamanote Line is 1,134,963 passengers per km of route, and the daily ridership is estimated to be approximately 4 million people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yamanote Line, which translates to \"mountain's hand\" in English, indicative of its foothills location, was officially opened on March 1, 1885. As of 2020, it is operated by a fleet of 50 11-car E235 series electric multiple units (EMUs).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plans for the introduction of ATO (Automatic Train Operation) and the establishment of driverless trains on the line sometime in 2028.\n"

# Kanuni SDK

## Installation

Repository: https://github.com/git-markkuria/kanuni-layer-sdk

## Overview

The Kanuni Layer SDK provides utilities to validate and redact sensitive information from user prompts before they are sent to downstream services (for example, LLMs). It offers a small, easy-to-integrate API for prompt validation and redaction.

Key features:

- Prompt validation
- Sensitive data redaction (emails, SSNs, credit cards, phone numbers, etc.)
- Single-call integration

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```powershell
pip install kanuni-layer-sdk
```

Install from GitHub (latest source):

```powershell
pip install git+https://github.com/git-markkuria/kanuni-layer-sdk.git
```

Install locally for development:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/git-markkuria/kanuni-layer-sdk.git
cd kanuni-layer-sdk
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Quick start

The package exposes a convenient function `reduct(prompt: str, opted_in: bool = True) -> str` that validates and redacts sensitive content.

Example usage:

```python
from kanuni_layer_sdk import reduct

prompt = (
	"My name is John Doe, SSN 123-45-6789, email john.doe@example.com. "
	"Please give me directions to the nearest pharmacy."
)

# Redact using default settings (opted_in=True)
redacted = reduct(prompt)
print("Redacted prompt:\n", redacted)

# Force opt-out (no redaction) if you need the raw prompt
raw = reduct(prompt, opted_in=False)
print("Raw prompt (opted out):\n", raw)
```

Notes:

- `reduct` performs basic prompt validation, optionally applies a transformation step (if configured), and then redacts sensitive values. The function returns the transformed/redacted prompt as a string.
- Check `kanuni_layer_sdk/main.py` and the `kanuni_layer_sdk/modules` package for implementation details.

## Development

- Package code lives under the `kanuni_layer_sdk` package. The primary entrypoint is `kanuni_layer_sdk.reduct`.
- See `requirements.txt` for runtime dependencies.

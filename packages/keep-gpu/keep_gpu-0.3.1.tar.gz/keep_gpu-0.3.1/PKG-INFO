Contributions Welcome!

If you have ideas for new features or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

This project does not yet fully support ROCm GPUs, so any contributions, suggestions, or testing help in that area are especially welcome!

---

## Features

- Simple command-line interface
- Uses PyTorch and `nvidia-smi` to monitor and load GPUs
- Easy to extend for your own keep-alive logic

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install keep-gpu
```

## Usage

### Use keep-gpu as a cli tool

```bash
keep-gpu
```

Specify the interval in microseconds between GPU usage checks (default is 300 seconds):
```bash
keep-gpu --interval 100
```

Specify GPU IDs to run on (default is all available GPUs):
```bash
keep-gpu --gpu-ids 0,1,2
```

### Use keep-gpu api in your code

Non-blocking gpu keeping logic with `CudaGPUController`:
```python
from keep_gpu.single_gpu_controller.cuda_gpu_controller import CudaGPUController
ctrl = CudaGPUController(rank=0, interval=0.5)
# occupy GPU while you do CPU-only work
# this is non-blocking
ctrl.keep()
dataset.process()
ctrl.release()        # give GPU memory back
model.train_start()   # now run real GPU training
```

Use `CudaGPUController` as a context manager:
```python
from keep_gpu.single_gpu_controller.cuda_gpu_controller import CudaGPUController
with CudaGPUController(rank=0, interval=0.5):
    dataset.process()  # GPU occupied inside this block
model.train_start()    # GPU free after exiting block
```

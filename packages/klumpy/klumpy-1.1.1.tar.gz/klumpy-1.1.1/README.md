# Klumpy: A tool to evaluate the integrity of long-read genome assemblies and illusive sequence motifs 

Initially developed to verify the Antifreeze glycoproteins in the genomes of two icefishes (see [Rivera-ColÃ³n, 2023](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/40/3/msad029/7035026)), `klumpy` now has expanded to include a suite of tools for assessing whether a particular region in a genome assembly is missassembled by leveraging the original data (i.e., raw reads) used in the assembly process, or it can instead be used to search for a gene of interest in a set of sequences.

The official `klumpy` website can be found [here](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/klumpy/).

The test cases within the [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1755-0998.13982) can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/Gio12/klumpy/src/master/TestCases/TestCases.md).


# Installation
```
python3 -m pip install klumpy
```

Current version: `1.1.0`

**NOTE**: `klumpy` uses `samtools` to parse *.bam* / *.sam* files, meaning `samtools` needs to be installed and available in the current path when providing `klumpy` an alignment file. 

# Components

`klumpy` currently is composed of 9 different subprograms, two are which are the primary subprograms, two which can illustrate the results, with the remaining 5 designed to supplement the four other subprograms. Depending on whether you have a gene of interest, as in the case with the Icefishes and AFGPs, you can start the analysis with `find_klumps`. If the aim is to assess the quality of your reference genome, the `scan_alignment` analysis would flag regions that were possibly missassembled.

```
# primary subprograms
    find_klumps:                Find query klumps in a set of subject sequences
    scan_alignments:            Scan a SAM/BAM file for misassembled candidate regions

# visualization subprograms
    alignment_plot:             Plot the alignments at a specified region using a SAM/BAM file
    klump_plot:                 Create a figure illustrating the klumps on the subject sequences

# accessory subprograms
    combine_klumps:             Combine klump tsv files from multiple runs
    find_gaps:                  Create a tsv file containing the positions of gaps from a reference genome
    get_exons:                  Create a fasta file of exonic sequences from a list of genes
    kmerize:                    Generate a map the query k-mers on the subject sequences
    klump_sizes:                Print out the expected klump sizes for each sequence
    
```
# Primary Subprograms

## find_klumps
The `find_klumps` subprogram accepts a set of sequences from `--query` and locates their substrings (i.e., k-mers) in the `--subject` sequence(s). `find_klumps` uses the locations of matching k-mers to construct *klumps* (i.e., clusters of matching k-mers). The two arguments that tend to have the largest effect on the results are `--range` and `--min_kmers`. The `--range` parameter sets the maximum number of base pairs two k-mers can be apart from one another while still being in the same klump. The `--min_kmers` is the minimum number of k-mers required to form a klump. As one may want to try different parameters when detecting klumps, a *query_map.gz* is generated. This file can be directly fed to `find_klumps` using the `--query_map` parameter to avoid repeatedly searching the `--subject` sequences for the same `--query` sequences. The `--threads` parameter is used to parallelize the `--query` search in the `--subject` sequences.

```
    --subject:                  Subject sequences in FAST[A|Q] format    
    --query:                    Query sequences in FAST[A|Q] format
    --query_map:                The query_map file generated from `find_klumps` or `kmerize`
    --output:                   Name of output file
    --range:                    Maximum distance two k-mers must be in order to be considered within the same klump (default = 1000)
    --min_kmers:                Minimum number of k-mers needed to form a klump (default = 1)
    --threads:                  Number of threads (default = 1)

    Advanced options:
        --ksize:                    Length of K-mer (must be an integer greater than 0) (default = 17)
        --query_count:              Minimum number of different queries a sequence is matched to (default = 1)
        --klump_count:              Minimum number of klumps a sequence must have (default = 1)
        --limit:                    Number of subject sequences to load into memory at once (default 10000)  
```

 As guidance, you may want to run `klump_sizes` (see section on `klump_sizes` below) to have an idea on the expected number of k-mers a query sequence (i.e., a klump) is represented by. 


```
# using subject & query sequences
klumpy find_klumps --subject input1.fa.gz --query input2.fa --min_kmers 2 --range 50

# using the query_map.gz file directly
klumpy find_klumps --query_map query_map.gz --min_kmers 2 --range 50
```

The output is a simple table in `.tsv` format. The content of the file will look something below.
```
# klumpy find_klumps --subject input1.fa.gz --query input2.fa --min_kmers 2 --range 50
Sequence	Seq_Length	Klump	Klump_Start	Klump_End	Query	Kmer_Count	Direction
seq1	    18072	    Klump1	5169	    5247	    query1	79	        F
seq2	    15037	    Klump1	979         1091	    query2	113	        R
```

Where the first line documents the command used to generate the file, followed by several columns. The columns are as follows
```
Sequence:       Name of the sequence
Seq_Length:     Length of the sequence
Klump:          Name of klump (e.g., klump1, klump2, etc..)
Klump_Start:    1-based start position of the klump in the sequence
Klump_End:      1-based end position of the klump in the sequence
Query:          Name of the query source for the klump
Kmer_Count:     Number of k-mers in the klump
Direction:      Orientation on the sequence the klump is found
Pair_Num:       1 or 2 depending if the sequence is from R1 or R2 data (only if data is paired-end, column is excluded otherwise)
```

This table can then be used for both the `klump_plot` and `alignment_plot` sub-programs to visualize the klumps. The `--output` argument is optional if there is a desired output name. If a `--subject` argument is provided, it uses the `--subject` input name, and adds a *_klumps.tsv* extension to the name. Otherwise, the default output name is *query_klumps.tsv*. As guidance for klump construction, the subprogram `klump_sizes` (see section on `klump_sizes` below) can be used to develop an idea on the expected klump size for each query sequence.

### Advanced options

`--query_count` sets the minimum number of query sources a sequence must have to not be filtered out. For instance, if you are only interested in sequences that have klumps from >1 query sequence (such as the case when searching for sequences containing multiple exons), you may want to set `--query_count` to 2 or greater. Similarly, if you are only interested in sequences that have more than 1 klump, you could set `--klump_count` to 2 or greater. The `--ksize` parameter sets the k-mer length during the k-mer mapping stage, and the `--limit` parameter regulates the number of sequences read into memory at once. By default, `--limit` is set to 10K sequences. However, if `--limit` is not *explicitly* used in the command, `klumpy` will lower the limit to 3 if it encounters sequences 1 Mb or longer.

## scan_alignments

The `scan_alignments` program applies `klumpy`'s grouping algorithm across an assembly and aims to provide the user with locations that may be missassembled. By identifying which regions have *N* or more groups (based on the criteria as described in `alignment_plot`), users are not restricted to having prior knowledge on which loci to investigate. The software takes the same grouping arguments as `alignment_plot`, with a couple additional parameters.
```
    --alignment_map:            A sorted and indexed SAM/BAM file [Required]
    --min_len:                  Minimum length a sequence must be to retain an alignment in the grouping analysis (default = 2000)
    --min_percent:              Minimum percent a sequence must be aligned for the alignment to be retained in the grouping analysis (default = 50)
    --num_of_groups:            Number of groups at a window to flag the window (default = 3)
    --threads:                  Number of threads (default = 1)
    --annotation:               Gene annotations in GTF/GFF3 format [Optional]

    Advanced options:
        --deletion_len:             Minimum length of deletion to draw and split alignment into blocks (default = 100)
        --assume_sep_del:           If set, remove the assumption that overlapping alignments with deletions can be automatically grouped if compatible
        --clip_tolerance:           Number of clipped base pairs to tolerate when comparing two alignments for compatibility (default = 400)
        --del_tolerance:            Length (in bp) covered by a deletion to be tolerated when comparing two alignments for compatibility (default = 50)
        --per_overlap:              Minimum percent two sequences need to overlap one another in order to confidently consider them compatible (default = 75)
        --t_len:                    Minimum length a sequence must be in order to trust its assignment when grouping (default = 2000)
        --t_per:                    Minimum percentage a sequence must be aligned in order to trust its assignment when grouping (default = 30)
        --align_offset:             Maximum number of base pairs apart for two sequences to be considered aligned at the same position (default = 100)
        --min_grp:                  Minimum number of sequences in a group in order to retain the group (default = 2)
        --window_size:              Length (in bp) for the sliding window to be (default = 50000)
        --window_step:              Length (in bp) for the sliding window to slide down to establish the next window (default = 25000) 
        --limit:                    Maximum number of alignments to process in a window (default 10000)
        --flag_excess_groups:       If set, will report regions with greater than or equal to --num_of_groups parameter regardless if the region was tiled or not
```
With the exception of `--threads`, the main parameters are shared with `alignment_plot`. Here, a sliding window approach is implemented, and at each window, `klumpy`'s grouping algorithm is performed (see *Advanced options* under the `alignment_plot` section). The use of multiple threads (i.e., the `--threads` argument) is only useful if the alignment map contains more than 1 *reference* sequence (parallelization is implemented across reference sequences, not alignment records).

To perform a scan, one can run a command similar to this
```
klumpy scan_alignments --alignment_map input.bam --threads 16
```
Here, we used the default parameters of using sequences with a length of at least 2 Kbp (set by `--min_len`), with the default `--min_percent` value of 50, meaning that sequences where more half of the sequence is unmapped, are not retained in the scanning process.

The `--num_of_groups` argument sets the minimum number of groups a region must have in order to flag a region to be flagged as a possible missassembly if the `--flag_excess_groups` is set. If a *.gtf* or *.gff* file is provided to `--annotation`, only regions containing a gene will be processed (useful if you are only interested in annotated regions).

When running this software, temporary files will be written to disk using the naming scheme *Temp_seq_name.txt*, where the *seq_name* is the name of the reference sequence being scanned. **DO NOT DISGARD THESE FILES**, they will be removed after the data is merged. 

The temporary files contain flagged *windows* that look something like this
```
seq 400000  425000  1
seq 750000  775000  1
seq 775000  800000  2
```

Where the first column contains the sequence name, the second column the start position of the window, the third column contains the end position of the window, and the fourth columm contains the number of groups found. If an annotation file is provided, the temporary file would contain an additional column
```
seq 400000  425000  1   geneA,geneB,geneC
seq 750000  775000  1   geneX,geneY
seq 775000  800000  2   geneY,geneZ
```

Where the fifth column is added with a comma separated list containing the genes found in the window. Lastly, if using the `--flag_excess_groups` option, an additional column containing either a *T* or a *F* will be added between the third and fourth column to indicate whether the region was tiled (*T* or True) or not (*F* or False).

```
seq 400000  425000  F   1   geneA,geneB,geneC
seq 750000  775000  F   1   geneX,geneY
seq 775000  800000  T   2   geneY,geneZ
```

Once all the reference sequences have been scanned, they are merged into a single file. The output file will contain the same name as in the alignment map, with the added extension of *_Candidate_Regions.tsv*. For example, if the input was called *input.bam*, the output would be *input_Candidate_Regions.tsv*. Using the examples above, the resulting output would like this

```
# klumpy scan_alignments --alignment_map input.bam --threads 16
Region_Num  Reference_Seq   Start   End Number_of_Groups
1   seq 400000  425000  1
2   seq 750000  800000  1,2

# with annotation file provided
# klumpy scan_alignments --alignment_map input.bam --threads 16 --annotation input.gtf.gz
Region_Num  Reference_Seq   Start   End Number_of_Groups    Genes
1   seq 400000  425000  1 geneA,geneB,geneC
2   seq 750000  800000  1,2 geneX,geneY,geneZ

# with annotation file provided & flagging regions based on group number
# klumpy scan_alignments --alignment_map input.bam --threads 16 --annotation input.gtf.gz --flag_excess_groups
Region_Num  Reference_Seq   Start   End Tiled Number_of_Groups Genes
1   seq 400000  425000  F, 1 geneA,geneB,geneC
2   seq 750000  800000  F,T 1,2 geneX,geneY,geneZ
```

The first line of the output will contain the line of code provided used to start the analysis, while the second line contains the column headers. Here, *regions* are reported instead of windows since `klumpy` will collapse overlapping windows since they represent the same locus. The *Reference_Seq* column contains the name of the reference sequence, and the *Start* and *End* columns contain positions of the region (**NOTE** these are 0-based positions). The *Genes* column is optionally added if an annotation file was used in the analysis. If a desired window is of interest, the *_Candidate_Regions.tsv* output can be supplied to `alignment_plot` using the `--candidates` option in combination with the `--region_num` argument to specify which region `klumpy` should plot instead of explicitly using `--reference`, `--leftbound`, and `--rightbound`.

#### Advanced options

The `scan_alignments` subprogram shares the majority of its arguments with `alignment_plot`, which both implement the grouping algorithm. New arguments include `--window_size` and `--window_step`. The software runs a sliding window across each reference sequence in the alignment map (i.e., a *SAM*/*BAM* file), and applies the grouping algorithm at each window. The size of the window is determined by `--window_size` (defaults to 50 Kb) and the sliding distance is set by `--window_step` (default = 25 Kb). Reference sequences that are shorter than `--window_size` are ignored. 

# Visualization Subprograms

## klump_plot
This program is used to visualize the klumps from the *.tsv* file generated from `find_klumps`. It only requires 1 argument, with a number of optional parameters to annotate the image or modify the output file.
```
    --klumps_tsv:               Klump tsv output generated from `find_klumps` [Required]
    --color:                    Color to use for drawing klumps (default = blue)
    --list_colors:              If set, the program will list the available colors for klumps and exit
    --fix_width:                If set, all the sequences in the figure will have the same `image` width
    --gap_file:                 File containing locations of gaps in the sequences (generated using `find_gaps`)
    --seq_name:                 Name of specific sequence to plot
    --format:                   Output format to draw image on. Choices are `pdf`, `png`, and `svg` (default = pdf)
    
    Advanced options:
        --klump_colors:             A tsv file containing the names of the query sources and the color to paint the query-specific klumps
        --color_by_gene:            If set and in combination with --klump_colors, will color all exons belonging to the same gene
        --leftbound:                Leftmost Position to plot --seq_name (default = 1) [requires --seq_name]
        --rightbound:               Rightmost Position to plot --seq_name (default = 50000) [requires --seq_name]
        --tick_count                If used, specify the number of ticks to use on the specified sequence [requires --seq_name]
        --tick_span                 If used, specify how many base pairs the ticks on the specified sequence should be apart [requires --seq_name]
```
Using `--list_colors` will list out a variety of colors to select from (currently at 64 options), to color the klumps (sequences are set to a light grey)
```
klumpy klump_plot --list_colors # other arguments will be ignored if used
```

To illustrate `klump_plot`'s use, an example is shown below
```
klumpy klump_plot --klumps_tsv input_klumps.tsv --color blue
```

The resulting file is written by default in pdf format, but can be changed using the `--format` option, which accepts either *pdf*, *png* or *svg* as a value. The ouput file will have the same name as the file passed to `--klumps_tsv`. For example, the output for *input_klumps.tsv* would be *input_klumps.pdf*. Below is an example of 6 sequences

<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/klump_plot_example1.png" alt="drawing" style="width:600px;height:300px"/>
</p>

Sequences are sorted by sequence length, with the shortest sequence at the top, and the longest sequence at the bottom. Furthermore, since the number of sequences to plot is unknown, the height of the pdf is extended so that each sequence is equally spaced apart. The klump labels begin with the number of k-mers in the klump, separated by a **-** from the name of the query source.

If using the `--fix_width` flag is implemented, there will be no relative scaling done on the sequences.

```
klumpy klump_plot --klumps_tsv input_klumps.tsv --color blue --fix_width
```
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/klump_plot_example2.png" alt="drawing" style="width:600px;height:300px"/>
</p>

In the case in which you are interested in a particular locus in a specific sequence, the `--seq_name` flags can be used.

```
klumpy klump_plot --klumps_tsv input_klumps.tsv --color blue --seq_name Seq4
```
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/klump_plot_example3.png" alt="drawing" style="width:600px;height:100px"/>
</p>

If the sequences contain gaps, the output of `find_gaps` can be used to annotate the figure with the sequence gaps (see `./TestCases/TestCases.md` for an example where we viewed gaps across several *Bombus* reference genomes)

### Advanced options

The `--klump_colors` and `--color_by_gene` parameters accept a *.tsv* file and uses that to map a color to a specific query source. If the color is unavailable, the program will report back to the user the error and exit. Not every query source needs to be present in the *.tsv* file, as those unlisted sources will be defaulted to a blue color. An example of an acceptable tab-delimited file is shown below

```
Query1  blue
Query2  maroon
Query3  teal
Query4  forestgreen
Query5  lavender
Query6  cyan
```
Assuming the file is named *klump_colors.tsv*, the following command illustrates its use
```
klumpy klump_plot --klumps_tsv input_klumps.tsv --fix_width --klump_colors klump_colors.tsv
```
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/klump_plot_example_colors.png" alt="drawing" style="width:600px;height:300px"/>
</p>

The file supplied to `--color_by_gene` is treated differently, as this argument was designed to work with the results of the `get_exons` subprogram. Sequences obtained with `get_exons` will have the extension *_EN* in the sequence header, where *E* is short for Exon and *N* is for the *N*<sup>th</sup> exon. So if using the above example, all klumps with *query1_E[N]* will be colored blue (*N* being any number).

To view a specific region in a specific sequence in the klumps *.tsv* file, the `--leftbound` and `--rightbound` parameters can be used.

```
klumpy klump_plot --klumps_tsv input_klumps.tsv --color blue --seq_name Seq4 --leftbound 5e3 --rightbound 7e3
```
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/klump_plot_example4.png" alt="drawing" style="width:600px;height:100px"/>
</p>

Further customization can be performed with the `--tick_count` and `--tick_span` parameters, both of which are only implemented when viewing a single sequence. `--tick_count` specifies the number of tick markers in the drawing, while `--tick_span` will set the length (in base pairs) between tick markers.

```
klumpy klump_plot --klumps_tsv input_klumps.tsv --color blue --seq_name Seq4 --tick_count 20
```
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/klump_plot_example5.png" alt="drawing" style="width:600px;height:100px"/>
</p>

```
klumpy klump_plot --klumps_tsv input_klumps.tsv --color blue --seq_name Seq4 --tick_span 2e3
```
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/klump_plot_example6.png" alt="drawing" style="width:600px;height:100px"/>
</p>

# kmerize
The `kmerize` subprogram performs the `--query` search in the `--subject` sequences implemented by `find_klumps`. A *query_map.gz* file will be generated, but no klump construction will be performed. All parameters available to `kmerize` are those which are also available to `find_klumps` (see `find_klumps` section for details ).

```
    --subject:                  Subject sequences in FAST[A|Q] format [Required]    
    --query:                    Query sequences in subject sequences, in FAST[A|Q] format [Required]
    --threads:                  Number of threads (default = 1)
    
    Advanced options:
        --ksize:                    Length of K-mer (must be an integer greater than 0) (default = 17)
        --limit:                    Number of subject sequences to load into memory at once (default 10000)
```

The only required options are `--subject` and `--query`. If there are multiple sequences in `--subject`, you can provide >1 `--threads` to perform a parallelized search. Here is an example of how to run the program.

```
klumpy kmerize --subject input1.fa.gz --query input2.fa --threads 4 
```

The first line is a print out of the command used to run the analysis. The second line is used to keep track of the kmer size (which is used by `find_klumps`). The third line specifies the time the analysis began, and the following line presents the format of the k-mer coordinates. Following, the lines start off with the name of the sequences in `--subject` (here, *seq1* and *seq2*), followed by the length of the sequence encapsulated in *[]*. After the colon, information on a k-mer found in the sequence that is shared with one of the sequences in `--query` is listed, with the start position of that k-mer on the subject sequence, the orientation the k-mer is found in that sequence, and the name of the query sequence that the k-mer originated from. **NOTE**: k-mer positions are 0-based.

So for subject sequence *seq1*, the sequence has a length of 18,072 bp, and has 4 shared k-mers with query sequence *query1*, each which are found on the reverse orientation (denotated as *R*). This component of `klumpy` is computationally expensive, but once all the query k-mers are mapped onto the subject sequences, downstream analysis is quicker.

If you are working with paired-end data, you will have to run `kmerize` or `find_klumps` on the two pairs of reads **separately**, as trying to analyze them together delves into the field of sequence assemblies (e.g., contig creation), which there are a number of software that are designed for such tasks (e.g., [PEAR](https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/pear/)). `klumpy` will attempt to determine whether the data are *R1* reads or *R2* reads using the sequence header. More specifically, it assumes that sequences longer than 160 bp are not paired-end (this assumption may change in the future), and then looks for the following labels in the sequence header: */1*, */2*, *[space]1:*, or *[space]2:*. If present, the results are slightly changed to something like below
```

Where *_PAIRED1* at the end of the sequence name would indicate that the sequence is the first of the pair (i.e., a *R1* sequence). A *_PAIRED2* extension would signal that the sequence is from *R2* reads.

Notes: `klumpy` currently was not designed for protein sequences. Also, sequences that are shorter than `--ksize` are ignored in the analysis.

### Advanced options
By default, `--ksize` is set to 17 for all analysis in `klumpy`. Unless a specific `--limit` is set, `klumpy` will read 10,000 `--subject` sequences into memory at a time. If a sequence >=1 Mb in length is found and `--limit` is not explicitly used, `klumpy` will reduce the number of `--subject` sequences processed at a single time to 3.

# klump_sizes
This piece of code only takes in two arguments
```
    --fasta:                    Sequences to break down to k-mers, in FASTA format [Required]
    --ksize:                    Length of k-mer (must be an integer greater than 0) (default = 17)
```

The input is currently restricted to fasta files, but can be extended to fastq files if demand is high enough. As mentioned in `kmerize`, the default `--ksize` for each sub-program is 17. To run the program, simply execute
```
klumpy klump_sizes --fasta input.fa.gz --ksize 17
```

No files are written and instead, the following lines are printed
```
seq1 length 92: Klump size of 76 k-mers
seq2 length 223: Klump size of 207 k-mers
seq3 length 129: Klump size of 113 k-mers
seq4 length 129: Klump size of 113 k-mers
seq5 length 205: Klump size of 189 k-mers
```

Where the name of each sequence provided to `--fasta` is printed next to its length, and the number of k-mers of `--ksize` that the sequence can be broken down to. Sequences shorter than `--ksize` are ignored. The main purpose of this program is to help guide your filteration in `find_klumps` when selecting a `--min_kmers` value.

# combine_klumps
If you want to combine multiple klump *.tsv* files for, let's say, *R1* and *R2* reads, or raw reads and a reference genome, then `combine_klumps` should be implemented. Only two arguments are accepted by this software
```
    --output:                   Name of output file
    --klumps_tsv_list:          Names of files to combine (--klumps_tsv_list file1.tsv file2.tsv file3.tsv etc...) [Required]
```

The only required argument is `--klumps_tsv_list` which takes the files listed after the flag as its value. The `--ouput` argument is optional and by default, the resulting file is called *Combined_Klumps.tsv*. An example of how to run the software with 3 files is shown below

```
klumpy combine_klumps --output Combined_Klumps.tsv --klumps_tsv_list input1_klumps.tsv input2_klumps.tsv input3_klumps.tsv
```

The resulting combined klumps file can then be used in the `klump_plot` and `alignment_plot` subprograms.

# find_gaps

The `find_gaps` software that takes a fasta file (using `--fasta`), and generates a *tsv* file of the locations of gaps in the sequences. The motivation behind this tool is to map the gaps of a genome assembly in order to view this feature in `alignment_plot` or `klump_plot`. To run `find_gaps`, simply run
```
klumpy find_gaps --fasta reference_genome.fa.gz
```

The output will be named based on the input, with the added extension of *_gaps.tsv*. So in the example above, the output will be named *reference_genome_gaps.tsv*. The output will look like the following
```
Chrom   Start   End
ref_seq1 2758675 2759174

ref_seq5 5000507 5001006
```

# alignment_plot

This component of `klumpy` has the most arguments and generates one of the key outputs of the program. Here, the software is given a region to visualize, and creates an image of the alignments at the specified region. Examples will be illustrated using the raw Pac-Bio and RAD-Seq data and the assembled genome of the Mackerel Icefish from Rivera-ColÃ³n et al. 2023, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA857989).

```

The only required parameters are `--alignment_map`. The `--alignment_map` accepts a sorted and indexed *SAM* or *BAM* file, **which must be located in the same directory as its index file**. See [here](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-index.html) for details. The `--leftbound` and `--rightbound` values tell `klumpy` which region in the `--reference` to plot. Alternatively, one can supply the region number (`--region_num`) from a *_Candidate_Regions.tsv* file (`--candidates`) generated from `scan_alignments` to specify which locus to plot (see `scan_alignments` for details).

The `--min_len` flag accepts an integer and sets the minimum length a *sequence* must be in order to be kept in the plot. Similarly, `--min_percent` sets the minimum percent a *sequence* must be aligned to the reference in order for it to be kept. The `--klumps_tsv` argument takes in the *.tsv* generated from `find_klumps` or `combine_klumps` to annotate the sequences in the figure. If the *.tsv* file contains klumps for both the aligned sequences and the reference sequence, klumps will be plotted onto both. A vertical bar can be plotted above klumps contained in *reference sequence* by using the `--vertical_line_klumps` flag. To see what colors are available for klumps, you can use `--list_colors` to list the available colors (these are the same as the colors in `klump_plot`). The parameters used to control the color of the klumps are the same as those in `klump_plot` (see the `klump_plot` section for details)


No klumps are needed to run `alignment_plot`, and here we will demonstrate some of its usage on chromosome 24 in the Mackerel Icefish. Below, we plot the 4.47 Mb - 4.55 Mb region.
```
klumpy alignment_plot --alignment_map cgun_raw_reads.bam \
                      --reference 24 \
                      --leftbound 4.47e6 \    # could use 4470000
                      --rightbound 4.55e6 \   # could use 4550000
                      --min_len 1e4 \         # can use 10000
                      --min_percent 50        # could use 0.50
```
The output will resemble something along the lines of what is shown below
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/align_plot1.png" width="50%" height="75%">
</p>


The leftmost postitioned sequence is placed at the top, with the rightmost sequence positioned at the bottom (excluding the reference sequence). The alignments either are a light grey, indicating a forward alignment (in respect to the reference genome), or a shade of yellow, which represent alignments on the reverse strand of the reference genome. Several other features are shown here, notably deletions and clips.
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/align_plot1_zoom.png" width="50%" height="100%">
</p>

Zooming in, there are horizontal black lines that separate the blocks of the aligned portions of the sequence. These black lines represent deletions. Data such as Pac-Bio are known to have many small indels. As these may be due to sequencing errors as opposed to real biological indels, viewing these small indels may not benefit the user. By default, the `--deletion_len` argument is set to 100 (*Note* that this is an advanced parameter that). In other words, `klumpy` will draw deletions that are at least 100 bp in length. As insertions do not consume the reference sequence, they are ignored in the image. The light green extensions from the alignment represent soft clips in the alignment, while red lines extending from the alignment would indicate hard clips (not shown in example).

Additional annotation files that can be provided include `--gap_file` (file generated from `find_gaps`) and `--annotation`, which takes a *.gtf* or *.gff* file (can be compresssed) as input. Both these two files will annotate the reference sequence with any features located within region. For further annotation, `--vertical_line_gaps`, `--vertical_line_klumps`, and `--vertical_line_exons` will draw a dashed line above the desired feature in the reference sequence.

Example with `--annotation`.
```
klumpy alignment_plot --alignment_map cgun_raw_reads.bam \
                      --reference 24 \
                      --leftbound 4.47e6 \    # could use 4470000
                      --rightbound 4.55e6 \   # could use 4550000
                      --min_len 1e4 \         # could use 10000
                      --min_percent 50 \      # could use 0.50
                      --annotation cgun.gtf.gz
```

The output will resememble something along the lines of what is shown below
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/align_plot2.png" width="50%" height="100%">
</p>

Here, each gene is differentiated by its color. For example, gene *g_9529* is red while gene *g_16157* is a lighter blue. Each separate annotation represents an exon, with the first exon in the image for each gene being tagged with the name of the gene. Gene labels alternate in position, where one gene's label is drawn on top of the reference sequence, and the following gene's label will be drawn below the reference sequence. If a third gene is drawn, its label will then be drawn above the reference sequence and the pattern continues.
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/align_plot2_zoom.png" width="50%" height="100%">
</p>

Plotting a region where a gap is located, we can see the following
```
klumpy alignment_plot --alignment_map cgun_raw_reads.bam \
                      --reference 24 \
                      --leftbound 13.07e6 \    # could use 13070000
                      --rightbound 13.15e6 \   # could use 13150000
                      --min_len 1e4 \         # could use 10000
                      --min_percent 50 \      # could use 0.50
                      --annotation cgun.gtf.gz \
                      --gap_file cgun_gaps.tsv \
                      --vertical_line_gaps    # no input needed
```
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/align_plot3.png", width="50%" height="100%">
</p>

Here, it is clear that the gap connecting two contigs is directly below a deletion in several alignments. 

To present an example with klumps, we will annotate one of the *afgp* regions in our assembly & alignments.
```
klumpy alignment_plot --alignment_map cgun_raw_reads.bam \
                      --reference 3 \
                      --leftbound 3.7e6 \   # could use 3700000
                      --rightbound 4e6 \    # could use 4000000
                      --min_len 1.5e4 \     # could use 15000
                      --min_percent 75 \    # could use 0.75
                      --annotation cgun.gtf.gz \
                      --gap_file cgun_gaps.tsv \
                      --vertical_line_gaps \# no input needed
                      --klumps_tsv afgp_klumps.tsv
```

Here, it is clear that there is a gapless region containing relatively few AFGP loci in the Mackerel Icefish
<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/klumps_align_example.png" width="50%" height="100%">
</p>

The `--group_seqs` argument does not accept any input (i.e., just include the parameter in your command) and groups the sequences using `klumpy`'s grouping algorithm (see *Advanced options* for detials). 

## Advanced options

By default, only primary alignments are visualized, with the available options `--secondary` and `--supplementary` that can relax this constraint. To exclude primary alignments, simply use the flag `--no_primary`. **NOTE**: If using `--group_seqs`, `klumpy` will ignore the `--secondary` and `--supplementary` arguments as the algorithm was designed around primary alignments. It is recommend to not set these flags when using `--group_seqs`.

If you are interested in seeing poorly aligned sequences, the flag `--max_percent` will cap the percentage a sequence can be aligned (e.g., if you are interested in seeing sequences with <= 50% of their bases aligned).

If interested in plotting only a specific set of sequences, `alignment_plot` accepts a list of sequence names from a file using `--plotting_list`, and excludes any sequences in the given region that is not in the list. **NOTE** additional filters such as `--min_len` and `--min_percent` are still applied/active.

The list should be a single column list, with each sequence name occupying a single line
```
seq1_name
seq2_name
seq3_name
etc..
```
The `--view_span` argument is one that may not need much modification from its default value (1 Mb). Since clipped portions of an alignment are ignored when using `samtools view`, `klumpy` calls `samtools view ... [leftbound - view_span]-[rightbound + view_span]` to ensure that all alignments in the window (despite being clipped) are captured. 

The `--height` and `--width` flags can be used to manipulate the size of the image. **NOTE: images are not guaranteed to display the alignment clearly**. For example, if plotting regions with notably high coverage or low coverage, the pixel distripution may cause the drawings (both reference & alignments) to become distorted. `klumpy` does try to work around these cases by adjusting the image size when encountering these cases, but this aspect of `klumpy` remains an active line of development.

If `--number` is used, the aligned sequences will be numbered (starting from 0) from the leftmost alignment, to the rightmost alignment. This may be useful when trying to analyze specific alignments, where one can use the `--write_table` flag to write a *.tsv* file containing some basic information of each alignment, as shown below (**NOTE: the below table is just an example**). Additionally, if the sequences in the figure are of particular interest, they can be written out in fasta format by setting the `--write_seqs` flag (**NOTE: only sequences from primary alignments are written**).

```
Sequence	Sequence_Length	Chrom	    Flag	Position	Percent_Aligned	Clipped_Start	Clipped_End	Seq_Num
seq1	    19655	        ref_seq	    0	    3704012	    100.0	        None	        None	    0

```

The `Sequence` columns contains the name of the aligned sequence, and the `Sequence_Length` holds the length of the sequence. The `Chrom` columns contains the name of the reference sequence. The `FLAG` column contains the [sam flag](https://www.samformat.info/sam-format-flag) of the alignment. The `Position` column contains the leftmost *aligned* position of the alignment, and the `Percent_Aligned` column consists of the percentage the sequence was aligned. The `Clipped_Start` and `Clipped_End` columns can hold 3 different values: *None*, *S*, or *H*. If the sequence is not clipped (at the start or end of the *alignment*), then the value is *None*. If there is a soft clip, the value is an *S*, with *H* indicating a hard clip. If using `--number`, a `Seq_Num` column is added. If using `--group_seqs`, then a `Group_Num` column will be added (see below for details on `--group_seqs`). To generate a table like the one above, one just needs to set to flags. The output file will have the naming scheme *Results_NumAlignments_records_Chrom_leftbound_rightbound.tsv* where *NumAlignments* is the number of alignment records retained, and *Chrom, leftbound* and *rightbound* indicating the location of the reference investigated.

To plot paired-end data, you **must** use the `--paired` flag. The plotting scheme is different for paired-end data, where the pair of sequences are plotted on the same line, and `R1` sequences are plotted in green, and `R2` are colored as blue. 

Illustrating an example with some Restriction-site Associated Sequencing (RAD-Seq) data.
```
klumpy alignment_plot --alignment_map cgun_raw_reads_rad.bam \
                      --reference 24 \
                      --leftbound 1.69e5 \    # could use 169000
                      --rightbound 1.71e5 \   # could use 171000
                      --min_len 100 \         # min length should be set for short reads
                      --min_percent 50 \      # could use 0.50
                      --annotation cgun.gtf.gz \
                      --paired                # no input needed

Here, the reads are aligned right at an exon of `cdk15`, which is a *cyclin-dependent kinase*.

`--group_seqs` is used to signal to `klumpy` to attempt to group the alignments based on their alignment patterns. Before describing some of the parameters, it must be noted that the grouping algorithm is **only** applied on *primary* alignments and *non-paired-end* data.

The grouping algorithm first starts by trying to group "good" alignments (i.e., alignments without large deletions or clipping). This is based on the assumption that alignments in missassembled regions tend to have features such as clipping and deletions. Most of the grouping-specific featuers are designed to work with these features.

First, the `--assume_sep_del` flag is used to *turn off* the assumption that alignments with deletions *should* be grouped together if there is their deletions span the same region in the reference. The `--per_overlap` takes a percentage (e.g., 50 or 0.50), which sets the minimum percentage that alignments need to overlap one another (i.e., both alignments need to overlap each other by `--per_overlap`) to be *considered* a good match (i.e., this alone does not result in the two alignments being grouped together).

The `--t_len` and `--t_per` arguments work similarly to `--min_len` and `--min_percent`. The `--t_len` argument is used to set the "trust" length, which any *sequence* below this length will be ignored when grouping as it is assumed to be untrustworthy. Likewise, any *sequence* with an aligned percentage lower than `--t_per` is also ignored when grouping. The rationale for these parameters is to avoid trying to bin short and poorly aligned sequences that cannot be reliably placed into a single group.

The `--clip_tolerance` argument is used to set the number of clipped base pairs that can be tolerated between two alignments. Below is a simple case.

<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/clip_tolerance.png" width="50%" height="75%">
</p>

Here, a clip from alignment B is overlapping an aligned portion of alignment A. If `--clip_tolerance` is shorter than the *clip overlap*, the two alignments are considered incompatible. Otherwise, they can still be compatible. 

The `--del_tolerance` is similar to `--clip_tolerance`, except that it evaluates the deletion overlaps.

<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/del_tolerance.png" width="50%" height="75%">
</p>

If the value provided to `--del_tolerance` is shorter than the *deletion overlap*, then the two sequences are considered incompatible.

In `--group_seqs`, alignments that begin at the same position are assumed to represent the same locus, as it is reasonable to assume the two sequences are of the same origin if starting at the same site. Since two alignments may not *exactly* align at the same position, but can be loosely interpretted as aligning to the same position, the `--align_offset` provides some wiggle room.

<p align="center">
<img src="./Images/align_offset.png" width="50%" height="75%">
</p>

The offset applies both to the left and right side of the aligned portions of an alignment (here, alignment A). For visual purposes, only alignment A is being checked in the illustration, but this evaluation is also applied from the perspective of alignment B.


To illustrate a simple case, we will apply the grouping algorithm to a 50 Kb region on chromosome 3 using default parameters

```
klumpy alignment_plot --alignment_map cgun_raw_reads.bam \
                      --reference 3 \
                      --leftbound 10.2e6 \      # could use 4470000
                      --rightbound 10.25e6 \    # could use 4550000
                      --min_len 2.5e4 \         # 25 Kb
                      --min_percent 75 \        # same as 0.75
                      --annotation cgun.gtf.gz \
                      --group_seqs              # no input needed
```

</p>

Here, the sequence alignments are colored based on the group they were assigned to. Alignments that are ungrouped are left white. Here, there are two groups. 

To illustrate an unresolved region, we will focus on a region where the algorithm struggles to find 2 or less groups while keeping the parameters the same. Additionally, we will annotate the image with the gaps in the region.

```
klumpy alignment_plot --alignment_map cgun_raw_reads.bam \  # using a different chrom for example
                      --reference 3 \
                      --leftbound 6.9e6 \           # 6.9 Mb
                      --rightbound 7.08e6 \         # 7.08 Mb
                      --min_len 2.5e4 \             # 25 Kb
                      --min_percent 85 \            # same as 0.85
                      --annotation cgun.gtf.gz \
                      --group_seqs \                # no input needed
                      --gap_file cgun_gaps.tsv \
                      --vertical_line_gaps          # no input needed
```

Within this 180 Kb region, 4 contigs are stitched together as indicated by the 3 gaps (stretches of *N*'s). Interestingly, the third contig (~6.99 Mb - 7.65 Mb) was predicted to be composed of three groups, with two of the groups having some overlap with each other. In this example, `klumpy` predicts 12 groups within this region. Although this is likely to not be the true number of groups, the binning of sequences into their respective groups can aid in the reconstruction of problematic loci.

The remaining grouping-based arguments are `--min_grp`, `--write_groups` and `--write_edge_seqs`. The `--min_grp` flag accepts an integer to set as the minimum number of sequences required to form a group. The `--write_groups` flag is set to tell the program to write the groups to group-specific fasta files, which can be used for tasks such as local reassemblies or annotations. If your interests are more on clipped sequences at the ends/edges of the groups, implementing the `--write_edge_seqs` will write out the names of the clipped sequences at the ends/edges of the groups into group-specific *.txt* files. The following image highlights some of the edge sequences from above.

# get_exons

The purpose of this subprogram is to take a list of genes, and extract out their exonic sequences from a reference assembly. All arguments are required for this program.
```
    --fasta:                    Reference genome in fasta format [Required]
    --annotation:               Gene annotations in GTF/GFF3 format [Required]
    --genes:                    Names of genes from which to extract exons from [Required] (e.g., --genes gene_name1 gene_name2 gene_name3)
```

Usage of `get_exons` is shown bellow
```
klumpy get_exons --fasta reference.fa.gz --annotation ref_annotations.gtf.gz --genes geneA geneB geneC
```

The resulting output is a fasta file called *exon_sequences.fa*. The name of the sequences follow the scheme *>gene_name_EN*, where *gene_name* is the name of the gene, *E* is short for exon, and *N* is the *N*<sup>th</sup> exon of that gene (e.g., geneA_E5 would be short for exon 5 of gene A). In the case where the gene is duplicated (i.e., there are multiple genes with the same name in the annotation file), then the name would use the naming scheme *>gene_name_M_EN* where *M* is the *M*<sup>th</sup> copy of that gene found in the annotation file. If the gene is on the reverse strand (denoted as `-` in the annotation file), then the extracted sequence is reverse complemented.

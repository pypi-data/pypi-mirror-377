# Source: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
#
# The JDK specified here is installed automatically on invocations of `./gradlew`
# and is used by Gradle itself to run, which then uses it as the default JDK `toolchain`
# for the entire build.
#
# NOTE: these URLs must point to a JDK that matches the declared JDK_VERSION above, else
#       the BAD_JDK_VERSION_ERROR will be triggered
#
# IF THESE URLs CHANGE: `./gradlew wrapper` must be run after any edits for them to take effect,
#   and `./gradlew check` should also be run to ensure the new JDK is loaded and verified

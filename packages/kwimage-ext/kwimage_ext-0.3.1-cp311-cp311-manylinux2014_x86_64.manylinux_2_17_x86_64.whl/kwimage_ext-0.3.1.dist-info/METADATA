The ``kwimage_ext`` module, which contains binary extensions for the ``kwimage`` module.

Setting the environment variable ``DISABLE_C_EXTENSIONS=1`` will disable C
extensions at compile time, but this package is mostly C-extensions, so that's
not very useful.


Note, that when building from source, the build may fail if you not in a fresh
state (related to
`skbuild-386 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/issues/386>`_. You
can mitigate this by running ``python setup.py clean`` to remove build
artifacts. Building from a clean environment should work.

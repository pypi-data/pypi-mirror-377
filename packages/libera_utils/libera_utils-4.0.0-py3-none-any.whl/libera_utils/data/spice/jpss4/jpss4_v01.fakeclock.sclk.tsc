Fake SCLK Kernel for Spacecraft with ID -143013
--------------------------------------------------------

    TODO[LIBSDC-601]: Uses NOAA20 (JPSS-1) base ID, needs updating to JPSS-4 at launch.

   This SCLK kernel contains the data necessary for converting from
   ephemeris time (ET) to ticks for a fake clock associated with the
   spacecraft with ID code. This fake clock runs at the same rate
   as ET, starting at ET 1980-JAN-06-00:00:00.000 and going for 100
   years. It has two fields -- seconds and milliseconds. The clock's
   granularity is 1 millisecond.

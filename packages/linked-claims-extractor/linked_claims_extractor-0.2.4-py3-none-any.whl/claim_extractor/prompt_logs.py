        Consider this meta information when filling the fields

        {self.meta}

        If no clear claim is present, you may return an empty json array. ONLY derive claims from the provided text.        
        Output format: Return ONLY a JSON array of claims with no explanatory text, no preamble, and no other content. The output must start with [ and end with ].

    'v2' : """
        You are a JSON claim extraction specialist. Your task is to analyze input text and identify factual claims that can be proven true or false through evidence matching the following schema:
        {self.schema}

        Meta Context for Claims:
        {self.meta}

        Instructions:
        1. Focus only on extracting claims that can be verified with evidence
        2. Thoroughly examine the provided text while cross-referencing the schema requirements
        3. Only extract claims that are explicitly stated or strongly implied in the text
        4. Maintain strict adherence to the defined schema structure
        5. If no claims match the criteria, return an empty array []
        6. Never invent claims or use external knowledge
        7. Prioritize precision over quantity
        8. If the text contains formatting artifacts or appears to be a fragment from a PDF, carefully analyze it to identify any verifiable claims despite these issues
        

        Output Guidelines:
        - ALWAYS output a valid JSON array (starting with [ and ending with ])
        - NEVER include markdown formatting or code blocks
        - NEVER add explanations, disclaimers, or non-JSON content
        - Ensure proper JSON syntax and escaping
        - Maintain case sensitivity as defined in the schema

        Response must be exclusively the JSON array with no additional text.

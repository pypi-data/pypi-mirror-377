The tests in this directory run in parallel under pytest.  The tests are run in such a way that
each method is run in a different process. Because of this, conflicts can arise in the way files
and directories are created and destroyed, if they overlap.  Ordinarily these conflicts would
be resolved by using one of the mktemp-style calls to create unique file names, but the nature
of the configuration files and expected directory names doesn't make this possible.  While at
first glance there appears to be overlapping files that can be merged, special care must be
taken to ensure that the tests will still run in parallel, and that no race conditions occur.

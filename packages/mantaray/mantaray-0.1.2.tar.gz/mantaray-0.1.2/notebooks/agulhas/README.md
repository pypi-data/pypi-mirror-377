# Ray Tracing in the Agulhas Current

The `notebook/` subdirectory includes the `agulhas_example.ipynb` jupyter notebook and the supporting functions in `src.py`.

## Additional requirements
Before running this example, create a folder `data/` within this directory and download and place the required data files from the [sample data release](https://github.com/mines-oceanography/mantaray/releases/tag/d0.0.7) in there. For this example, you will need to download `globcurrent.nc`, `current_agulhas`, and `bathy_agulhas`.

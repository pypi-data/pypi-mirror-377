# Comparison of mantaray and theoretical solutions

This example performs ray tracing on simple examples where the trajectory can be calculated analytically.

1. First run all cells in `data_generation.ipynb` to generate data used in this example.
2. Run `snells_law_verification.ipynb` for analytical ray tracing.

Additional supporting functions are included in `support.py`.

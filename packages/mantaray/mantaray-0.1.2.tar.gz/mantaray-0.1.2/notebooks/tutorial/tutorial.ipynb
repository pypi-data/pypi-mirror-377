    "# How to Add Your Jupyter Notebook Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure that your notebook is well-formatted for documentation and reproducible by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finalizing your notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to keep your notebook clean, structured, and functional:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure you are using relative file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: `ds_nazare = xr.open_dataset('/data/s2_nazare.nc')`\n",
    "- Avoid something like `ds_nazare = xr.open_dataset('C:/Users/your_name/ray_tracing/notebooks/your_folder/data/s2_nazare.nc')`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Include required data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your example requires generated data, include the code that creates it.\n",
    "- Include actual data files in a `data/` folder within your example directory.\n",
    "- Do not include synthetic data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Refactor helper functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Move non-essential functions to a `support.py` file in your subfolder.\n",
    "- Keep function definitions in the notebook if their implementation is meaningful to the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Remove unnecessary code and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove print statements used for debugging unless they add value.\n",
    "- Delete commented-out code unless it serves as a meaningful explanation.\n",
    "- Delete any unused cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Present output in a clear and readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use tables, formatted strings, or labeled figures.\n",
    "- Output should be clear and understandable to the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Ensure clear markdown organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use headers for organization (# Title, ## Section, ### Subsection).\n",
    "- Include a sentence or two explanation after each header.\n",
    "- Verify that markdown renders correctly, especially for math formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important note: use the `#` header only once for the title of your file. If you include it multiple times, the documentation will not render properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Ensure code executes properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Re)Run `pixi run -e docs develop`\n",
    "- Restart the kernel and run all cells.\n",
    "- Ensure all cells execute successfully in the `docs` environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Proper style.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Ruff for formatting and linting:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pixi run ruff format path/to/file\n",
    "pixi run ruff check path/to/file\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Use meaningful variable names.\n",
    "- Write clear but non-redundant comments.\n",
    "- Include docstrings for functions (\"\"\"Description\"\"\").\n",
    "- Check spelling and grammar in markdown, comments, and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding your example to the documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your notebook is polished, follow these steps to include it in the notebooks gallery:\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Save your notebook in the right location.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a subfolder inside the `notebooks/` directory to contain your example.\n",
    "- Example: this file is located at `notebooks/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Add notebook to the gallery.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Append your notebook filename (without `.ipynb`) to `docs/gallery_header.rst`.\n",
    "- Example: this notebook is `tutorial.ipynb`, so `tutorial` is appended to `docs/gallery_header.rst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important note: If a name conflict exists, rename your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Make sure the docs build with no error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SPHINXOPTS=\"-W --keep-going -n\" pixi run -e docs python-docs\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Ensure there are no errors.\n",
    "- Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in a browser and confirm your notebook appears in the gallery.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Submit your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If everything works, open a Pull Request (PR) to add your example! ðŸŽ‰\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Getting help.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have any questions or following these instructions does not work, please ask!"

# Integration tests

The rust test modules are located in this source directory since there is no
public interface for Rust.

This test module currently contains:
- `test_constant_depth.rs`: verify rays in zero current and constant depth
- `linear_beach.rs`: verify rays in zero current and constant slope beach.

# mapFolding

[![pip install mapFolding](https://img.shields.io/badge/pip%20install-mapFolding-gray.svg?colorB=3b434b)](https://pypi.org/project/mapFolding/)

Map folding, meanders, stamp folding, semi-meanders. Experiment with algorithm transformations and code optimization.

Command line:

- getOEISids
- OEIS_for_n

The package is focused on mapFolding and stamp folding. But "mapFolding/_oeisFormulas" has some infrastructure for meanders and semi-meanders.

There are innovations and insights in the mapFolding stuff.

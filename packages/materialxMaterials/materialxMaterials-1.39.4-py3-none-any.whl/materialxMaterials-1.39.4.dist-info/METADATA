           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

</a>
</p>

<p>
<hr>
<h5>2. AMD GPUOpen</h5>
A command line utility is available <a href="https://github.com/kwokcb/materialxMaterials/tree/main/javascript/JsGPUOpenLoaderPackage">here</a>. This uses <code>Node.js</code> to allow access to fetch materials from the <code>GPU Open</code> site(which is not available via a web page).
<p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kwokcb/materialxWeb/blob/main/flask/gpuopen/README.md">A <b>Flask</b> application</a> is also available which uses the Python package with a Web based front here.

<h5>3. ambientCg</h5>

A <b>NodeJS / Express</b> application can also be found on the <a href="https://kwokcb.github.io/materialxWeb/index.html" target="_blank">MaterialXWeb</a> site.

This is designed to be a general purpose MaterialX *material inspector* supporting `ambientCg` and `GPUOpen` currently with the intent to add new libraries as they become available.

<hr>
<h5>4. PolyHaven</h5>

A Python library and command `polyHavenLoader` and `polyHavenLoaderCmd` are currently available which can 
produce a filtered list of assets (textures) which have 
MaterialX representations. This list cna be used to download
specific assets and save to zip format. 

A Javascript library and Web interface is available <a href="https://kwokcb.github.io/materialxMaterials/javascript/JsPolyHaven/" target="__default">here</a>. Filtering by classification, name tags, and dependent image resolution is available. Materials may be previewed and / or saved.

<h4>Library Dependencies</h4>

The Python utilities require:

1. The MaterialX 1.39 or greater package for PhysicallyBased OpenPBR shader creation. The current build is against 1.39.4.
2. The `requests` package.
3. The `pillow` package for image handling for GPUOpen package handling

The GPUOpen Javascript logic requires:
1. `node-fetch` if fetch is not available in the version of Node.js used. 
2. `yargs` for the command line utility 

<h4>Package Building</h4>

The <a href="https://github.com/kwokcb/materialxMaterials"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwokcb/materialxMaterials/4125d04c73fc2b1755f5b6054b25b6d1bdabcf6b/documents/icons/github-mark-white.svg" width=16px> GitHub repository</a> can be cloned.

The Python package can be built using:

```shell
pip install .
```

This will pull down the dependent Python packages as needed.

Build scripts can be found in the `utilities` folder.

- `build.sh` will install the package and run package commands to update package data.
- `buildDocs.sh` will prepare documents and run Doxygen to build API docs.

The GPUOpen Javascript utility requires Node.js to be installed. From the package folder (`javascript\JsGPUOpenLoaderPackage`) the following should be run:

```shell
npm install     # Install dependent packages
npm run build   # Setup runtime area
```

<h4>Usage</h4>

<h5>Python Commands</h5>

- Query all materials fom PhysicallyBased and convert them to all  support shading models. Save the material list and corresponding MaterialX files in the default output location. The build will include this information Python package under the <code>data</code> folder.

  ```sh
  python physicallyBasedMaterialXCmd.py
  ```
  or 

  ```sh
  materialxMaterials physbased
  ```

- Query all materials fom GPUOpen. Extract out a few material packages (zip). Save the material lists, material names and unzipped packages (MaterialX and images) in the default output location. The build will include this information Python package under the <code>data</code> folder.

  ```sh
  materialxMaterials gpuopen --materialNames=1 --saveMaterials=1
  ```

- Download the materials list fom ambientCG: 

  ```sh
  materialxMaterials acg --saveMaterials True
  ```

- Extract out a material package for the "WoodFloor038" material from ambientCG requesting the 
package where the images are 2K PNG files:

  ```sh
  materialxMaterials acg --downloadMaterial "WoodFloor038" --downloadResolution 2
  ```
- Examine all texture assets on PolyHaven, and find all ones which have MaterialX resources. Does not download the asset.

  ```sh
  polyHavenLoaderCmd.py --fetch --download_id=""
  ```

- Extract out a specific MateriaX asset with a given identifier.
  ```sh
  polyHavenLoaderCmd.py --fetch --download_id="aerial_asphalt_01"
  ```
- Extract out the first 10 MaterialX assets.
  ```sh
  polyHavenLoaderCmd.py --fetch -c 10
  ```

- Scan locally downloaded MaterialX asset information to download.

  ```sh
  python -m materialxMaterials polyhaven --load --download_id="aerial_asphalt_01"
  ```

<h5>GPU Open Node.js Utility</h5>

The utility can be run from the `javascript\JsGPUOpenLoaderPackage` folder as follows:

```
npm start -- [<arguments>]
```
or:
```
node gpuOpenFetch.js [<arguments>]
```
with the appropriate arguments. It supports the same options as the Python utility -- namely material information, and package (zip) downloads. For the following 2 lines are equivalent to download a material called "Moss Green Solid Granite".
```
node gpuOpenFetch.js  -n "Moss Green Solid Granite"
npm start -- -n "Moss Green Solid Granite"
```

<h4>Library</h4>

A `Jupyter` notebook demonstrates the direct usage of the Python library. The output of the notebook can be found <a href="https://kwokcb.github.io/materialxMaterials/examples/materialxMaterials_tutorial_out_iframe.html">here</a>. The notebook can found in the Github repository under the `examples` folder.

<h4>Results</h4>

The following are some samples which have been rendered using the `MaterialXView` utility which is part of the MaterialX binary distribution.

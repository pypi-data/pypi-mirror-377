title: MCP Agent Cloud
description: "Deploy and manage AI agents as MCP servers"
---

## Overview

MCP Agent Cloud deploys your agents as MCP servers, where agent workflows become long-running MCP tools executed in a durable workflow orchestration engine (Temporal). This architecture enables:

- **Agents as MCP Servers**: Your agents are exposed as standard MCP servers that any MCP client can connect to
- **Workflows as Durable Tools**: Agent workflows are exposed as MCP tools that run durably via Temporal
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Built-in retry logic, fault tolerance, and state persistence

## Key Features

- **Agent Deployment**: Deploy agents as MCP servers accessible via HTTP/WebSocket
- **Temporal Integration**: Durable workflow execution with automatic retries
- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage and injection of API keys
- **Multi-Region Support**: Deploy to different regions for lower latency
- **Monitoring**: Real-time logs, metrics, and workflow tracking

## Deployment Process

1. Write your agent using mcp-agent framework
2. Configure deployment settings
3. Deploy with `mcp-agent deploy`
4. Access your agent via MCP protocol

## Architecture

### Core Concept: Agents as MCP Servers

When you deploy an agent to MCP Agent Cloud:

1. **Your agent becomes an MCP server** - Accessible via standard MCP protocol
2. **Workflows become MCP tools** - Each workflow is exposed as a tool that MCP clients can invoke
3. **Execution is durable** - Workflows run on Temporal, surviving failures and restarts
4. **Tools are long-running** - Unlike traditional tools, agent workflows can run for hours/days/weeks

### How It Works

```yaml
# Your agent definition
@app.workflow
class ResearchWorkflow:
    async def run(self, topic: str):
        # Long-running research task
        return results

# Becomes an MCP tool when deployed:
# Tool: "workflows-ResearchWorkflow-run"
# Returns: workflow_id and run_id for tracking
# Status: Check via "workflows-get_status" 
# Cancel: Use "workflows-cancel"
```

### Components

- **API Gateway**: Exposes agents as MCP servers (SSE/HTTP endpoints)
- **Agent Runtime**: Containerized execution environment for your agent code
- **Temporal Cluster**: Durable workflow orchestration engine
  - Workflows survive crashes and restarts
  - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
  - Pause/resume capabilities for human-in-the-loop
  - Complete execution history and replay debugging
- **Vault**: Secure secrets management
- **Monitoring Stack**: OpenTelemetry-based observability

### Why Temporal for Agent Workflows?

Agent workflows are fundamentally different from simple tool calls:
- They can run for extended periods (hours/days)
- They need to survive infrastructure failures
- They require pause/resume for human approval
- They benefit from automatic retries and error handling

Temporal provides all these capabilities out-of-the-box, making your agents production-ready.

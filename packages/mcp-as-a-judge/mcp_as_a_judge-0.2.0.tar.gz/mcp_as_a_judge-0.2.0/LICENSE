Prior Art and Attribution
While “LLM‑as‑a‑judge” is broadly known, this repository defines the original “MCP as a Judge” behavioral MCP pattern by OtherVibes and Zvi Fried. It combines task‑centric workflow enforcement (plan → code → test → completion), explicit LLM‑based validations, and human‑in‑the‑loop elicitation, along with the prompt templates and tool taxonomy provided here.

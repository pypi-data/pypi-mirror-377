- 🔧 `mcp-devtools` server offers a comprehensive suite of software development tools:
  -  🤖 Agentic editing (`ai_edit`)
  -  📁 File management (`read_file`, `write_to_file`)
  -  🎋 Git management (`git_diff`, `git_show`, `git_stage_and_commit`, `git_status`, `git_log`)
  -  🖥️ Terminal integration (`execute_command`)

## 1️⃣ Install

- **Python 3.12**, **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**
  - **Installation:** (🐧 🍎 Linux/macOS )
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
  - **Installation:** ( 🪟 Windows )
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
- **[Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)** (only needed for the `ai_edit` tool)
  - **Installation:**
    ```bash
    python -m pip install aider-install --break-system-packages && aider-install
    ```
    
    <details>
    <summary> <h4> Configuration: </h4> </summary>
    
    - Create or copy provided [.aider.conf.yml](./.aider.conf.yml) into your home directory (🐧`~/.aider.conf.yml`) or your project repo root (make sure to double check if its `.gitignore`d if you are going to keep API keys there, even though Aider should auto-ignore it on first run).  
    - Adjust Aider options to your needs (model, provider, base url, API keys, etc.).
    - Follow [📄 official Aider documentation](https://aider.chat/docs/config.html) for detailed descriptions of each available option.
    
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary> <h4> Usage: </h4> </summary>
    
    The `ai_edit` tool provides a powerful way to make code changes using natural language. It no longer automatically commits changes. Instead, it applies them to your working directory and provides a structured report for you to review.
    
    ##### How it Works
    
    1.  **Delegate a Task:** Call `ai_edit` with a clear instruction and the target files.
    2.  **Receive a Report:** The tool returns a report with:
        *   **Aider's Plan:** The approach the AI will take.
        *   **Applied Changes (Diff):** The exact changes made to your files.
        *   **Next Steps:** Instructions to manually review, stage, and commit the changes.
    3.  **Review and Commit:** You are in full control. Review the diff, and if you approve, stage and commit the changes using the `git_stage_and_commit` tool.
    
    Aider reads .aider.conf.yml itself. The MCP server does not override Aider configuration except enforcing chat history behavior based on the required continue_thread flag (passing --restore-chat-history or --no-restore-chat-history). Any additional options you pass via the ai_edit tool's options parameter are forwarded as-is.

    **Note on workspaces and Git worktrees (Experimental)**:
      - Git worktrees are EXPERIMENTAL and disabled by default.
      - Enable per-session worktrees by setting `MCP_EXPERIMENTAL_WORKTREES=1` (also accepts `true`/`yes`).
      - When enabled, `ai_edit` may create per-session worktrees under `.mcp-devtools/workspaces/<session_id>` and purge them on success; stale worktrees are cleaned up opportunistically based on session TTL.
      - Diffs and snapshot artifacts are still computed from and stored under the root repository (e.g., `.mcp-devtools/`), so user-facing behavior remains unchanged when disabled.

# ROLE AND DIRECTIVE

**You are a Senior Software Architect.** Your primary function is to architect software solutions by delegating all code implementation to a stateless coding agent via the `ai_edit` tool. Your expertise lies in meticulous planning, atomic delegation, and rigorous code review, not direct implementation.

---

# STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)

You must adhere to the following five-step, iterative workflow:

1.  **Analyze & Plan:** Thoroughly analyze the user's request and formulate a clear, high-level implementation plan. Break the problem down into the smallest possible, logical, and incremental steps.
2.  **Delegate ONE Step:** Translate **only the very next step** of your plan into a precise, actionable, and fully self-contained prompt for the `ai_edit` tool. **Never bundle multiple steps into a single delegation.** Default to continue_thread = false. Set continue_thread = true only when you intentionally build on the immediately preceding Aider conversation (e.g., iterative refinement of the same change).
3.  **Provide Full Context:** Because the agent is stateless, you must include all necessary context (e.g., file paths, relevant code snippets, class/function definitions) within your `ai_edit` prompt. (See "Agent Memory & Context Protocol" below). Always include file paths, the exact code blocks to modify, and relevant dependencies. This applies whether continue_thread is true or false.
4.  **Review & Verify:** Critically evaluate the diff generated by `ai_edit` after every execution. This is a **mandatory code review**.
    * Does the code correctly implement the single step you delegated?
    * Is the code quality acceptable?
    * Are there any errors or edge cases missed?
5.  **Iterate & Guide:**
    * **If Approved:** The step is complete. Proceed to delegate the *next* incremental step in your plan.
    * **If Revision is Needed:** The implementation is flawed. Provide corrective feedback in a new `ai_edit` prompt, again ensuring all context is provided, to guide the agent to the correct solution for that specific step.

---

# AGENT MEMORY MODEL (CONDITIONAL STATELESSNESS)

- The coding agent can be stateless or continue prior conversation, controlled by ai_edit's required continue_thread flag.
- If continue_thread = false:
  - Aider does not restore prior chat. Treat every call as a fresh agent with no memory.
  - Always include all the immediate context the agent needs: full file paths, the exact function/class to touch, and any dependent snippets.
- If continue_thread = true:
  - Aider restores prior chat history for continuity within the same repo/session.
  - Still include critical context to make the agent robust. Chat history is best-effort and is not a substitute for explicit, precise context.

## Choosing continue_thread
- Set false:
  - Switching features or tasks
  - After significant repository changes
  - When you want clean isolation between prompts
- Set true:
  - Iterating immediately on the same feature or fix
  - Correcting the previous Aider change
  - Resuming a short-lived session in the same repo

---

# CONSTRAINTS & TOOL PROTOCOL

**Primary Constraint:**
* You are **strictly prohibited** from writing or modifying application code directly. All code implementation must be delegated.
* **Forbidden Tools for Coding:** `apply_diff`, `write_to_file`, and `{your_native_tool_slug}` must NOT be used to modify code.

**Permitted Exception:**
* You MAY use file editing tools to create or modify non-code assets, such as documentation.

**`ai_edit` Tool Usage Rules:**
* `repo_path`: Always pass the full, absolute path of the current working directory.

## 🙈 Security Considerations

<details>
<summary> <h4> ⚠️ Show Disclaimer </h4> </summary>

- 🛡️ For automated workflows, always run MCP Servers in isolated environments:
  - Containers: 🐧 [daoch4n/systemd-nspawn-wayland](https://github.com/daoch4n/systemd-nspawn-wayland) 🍎 🪟 [Docker](https://github.com/docker/cli)
  - Sandboxes: 🐧 [Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail) 🪟 [Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie)
- 🗃️ Filesystem access boundaries are maintained via passing `repo_path` to every tool call, so AI agent only has read/write access to files in the current workspace (relative to any path AI decides to pass as `repo_path` , make sure system prompt is solid on cwd use).
- ⚠️ `execute_command` doesn't have strict access boundaries defined, while it does execute all commands with cwd set to `repo_path` (relative to it), nothing is there to stop AI from passing full paths to other places it seems fit; reading, altering or deleting unintended data on your whole computer, so execise extreme caution with auto-allowing `execute_command` tool or at least don't leave AI agent unattended while doing so. MCP server is not responsible for your AI agent executing rm -rf * in your home folder.

## ❔ FAQ

<details>
<summary> <h4> 💾 Direct Code Editing vs 🤖 AI-assisted Editing </h4> </summary>

**Issue:**

*    🔍 When using the `write_to_file` tool for direct code editing with languages like JavaScript that utilize template literals, you may encounter unexpected syntax errors. This issue stems from how the AI agent generates the `content` string, where backticks and dollar signs within template literals might be incorrectly escaped with extra backslashes (`\`).

**Mitigation:** 

*    🔨 The `write_to_file` tool is dynamically integrated with `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) for conditional type checking of `.js`, `.mjs`, and `.ts` files on edit. The output of `tsc --noEmit --allowJs` is provided as part of the tool's response. AI agent should parse this output to detect any compiler errors and should not proceed with further actions if errors are reported, indicating a problem with the written code.

**Workarounds:**

*    🤖 Instruct your AI agent to delegate editing files to the `ai_edit` tool. It's more suitable for direct code manipulation than `write_to_file`. `ai_edit` will apply the changes and return a diff for review. Your assistant can then orchestrate the review and commit process.

        "description": "Optional. The pruning mode to use when prune=true. 'summarize' creates a summary of older sessions, 'truncate' removes them. Defaults to 'summarize' if prune=true and prune_mode is not specified."
      }
    },
    "required": [

## Usage examples (stateless vs restored chat)
- Stateless (recommended):
  - continue_thread: false
  - Always include all context needed for the single step.
- With restored chat:
  - continue_thread: true
  - Still include critical context; do not rely solely on chat history.
  - Use this to refine a change made in the immediately previous run.

> Note: When `continue_thread` is false, the server prunes Aider chat memory by truncating `.aider.chat.history.md` in the repository root before invoking Aider.

> Also: After Aider completes, the server appends the last Aider reply from `.aider.chat.history.md` (last session only) to the tool output, with SEARCH/REPLACE noise removed for readability.

> Pruning: When `prune` is true, older chat sessions are either summarized or truncated based on `prune_mode`. By default, only the most recent session is kept (configurable via `MCP_PRUNE_KEEP_SESSIONS` environment variable).

### `aider_status`
- **Description:** Check the status of Aider and its environment. Use this to:
  1. Verify Aider is correctly installed
  2. Check API keys
  3. View the current configuration
  4. Diagnose connection or setup issues
- **Input Schema:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "repo_path": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The absolute path to the Git repository or working directory to check Aider's status within."
      },
      "check_environment": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "default": true,
        "description": "If true, the tool will also check Aider's configuration, environment variables, and Git repository details. Defaults to true."
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "repo_path"
    ]
  }

### `ai_sessions`
- **Description:** List active AI editing sessions or get the status of a specific session. Can optionally run TTL cleanup to remove expired sessions when listing (cleanup=true).
- **Input Schema:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "repo_path": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The absolute path to the Git repository's working directory."
      },
      "action": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The action to perform: 'list' sessions or get 'status' of a specific session.",
        "enum": [
          "list",
          "status"
        ]
      },
      "session_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Optional. The session ID to get status for. Required when action='status'."
      },
      "cleanup": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "default": false,
        "description": "Optional. If true, runs TTL cleanup when listing sessions. Defaults to false."
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "repo_path",
      "action"
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Example Usage:**
  ```json
  // List sessions with cleanup
  {"repo_path": "/abs/path/to/repo", "action": "list", "cleanup": true}
  
  // Get status of a specific session
  {"repo_path": "/abs/path/to/repo", "action": "status", "session_id": "<session_id>"}
  ```

Sample MCP Server Implementation

This package demonstrates how to build a complete MCP server using the mcp_foundation library.
It includes example tools, resources, and prompts for Kafka operations, system utilities,
and notification integrations.

This serves as both a working reference implementation and a learning resource
for developers building their own MCP servers.

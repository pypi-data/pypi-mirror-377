# 🧑‍⚖️ MCP Judge

An interactive interface for testing and inspecting your MCP tools. This Streamlit application helps you connect to an MCP server, list available tools, inspect their schemas, and run them with custom inputs, all from a clean, web-based UI.

## ✨ Features

* **Connect to any MCP Server:** Easily connect to a new MCP server by simply entering its URL.
* **Discover & Inspect Tools:** View a list of all available tools and their descriptions.
* **Dynamic Input Forms:** The app automatically generates input forms based on the tool's `inputSchema`.
* **Live Tool Testing:** Run any tool with your specified inputs and see the JSON output in real-time.
* **Clear, Intuitive Layout:** A clean, two-column design separates connection and tool selection from inputs and results, providing a professional user experience.

# metarace

A collection of Python modules to assist with cycle race timekeeping
and official result preparation. Version 2 of Metarace is a
re-write for Python 3 which removes static pyGTK/GLib dependencies.

Application-level modules are not contained in
the library, they are available separately:

   - [roadmeet](https://github.com/ndf-zz/metarace-roadmeet) : Timing
     and results for UCI Part 2 Road Races, UCI Part 5 Cyclo-Cross,
     criterium, road handicap and ad-hoc time trial events.
   - [trackmeet](https://github.com/ndf-zz/metarace-trackmeet) : Timing
     and results for UCI Part 3 Track Races.
   - [tagreg](https://github.com/ndf-zz/metarace-tagreg) : Transponder
     registration tool.
   - [ttstart](https://github.com/ndf-zz/metarace-ttstart) : Time
     Trial starter console.

A shared install script may be used to install metarace
applications on most POSIX systems:

	$ wget https://github.com/ndf-zz/metarace/raw/refs/heads/main/metarace-install.sh
	$ sh metarace-install.sh

For installation on Windows systems, a powershell script is provided
to install metarace applications under a WSL Debian container:

	wget https://github.com/ndf-zz/metarace/raw/refs/heads/main/wsl-install.ps1


In the following you could read all the steps to create data pipeline for your project: 

## 1. Data Ingestion (Collection of Raw Data)
This is the first stage, where raw data is gathered from various sources and ingested into the pipeline. It can be structured as per our case (databases, CSV files, APIs, Excels).

#### Examples:
- Batch Data: importing a CSV file of site data regularly like once a day.
- API Data: Pulling real-time data streams from the API.
- Database Extraction: Replicating data from a MySQL database to our own database.


## 2. Data Preprocessing (Cleaning and Standardization)
Before analysis, raw data is often messy and inconsistent. This step ensures data quality, removes duplicates, corrects errors, and formats it for the next processes. This step can be done manually or automated by code.

### Tasks in this stage:
- Check format like the headings and units per column
- Handling missing values (e.g., filling gaps with averages)
- Data deduplication (removing repeated records)
- Converting different formats (e.g., date formats across multiple sources, unit conversion)
- Encoding Data: Create identifiers for the samples name based on their location and country
- Normalization (converting text values to lowercase, trimming spaces, etc.)

#### Examples:
- Standardizing dates from different sources (e.g., converting MM-DD-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD)
- Convert units to SI units(e.g., pound to Kg, ft to m)
- Removing duplicate sample records from different sources
- Filtering out irrelevant data (e.g., the columns that we don't need)
- Sample name identifier example: NL_GRI_W_1

## 3. Data Transformation (Processing and Enrichment)
In this step, data is converted into a useful format, enriched with additional information, or aggregated for reporting. This step also can be done manually or automated by code.

### Common tasks in this stage:
- Joining Data: Merging datasets from multiple sources
- Data Enrichment: Calculating new values from initial data

#### Examples:
- Merging site measurments data with lab analyized data in one csv file
- Calculating isotop ratio according to Raleigh equation

## 4. Data Storage (Centralized Data Repository)
Once data is transformed, it is stored in an appropriate system depending on the use case.

### Types of Storage:
- Databases like UU YODA, MySQL
- GitHub repository

### Examples:
- Storing processed data in YODA

## 5. Data Validation & Monitoring for Each Data Analysis Module  (Quality Control)
This stage ensures that processed data is accurate, complete, and meets requirements to run different analysis.

### Common Checks:
- Schema validation (ensuring expected columns, required input data or calculated parameters exists)
- Anomaly detection (flagging unexpected values)
- Data freshness checks (ensuring updates occur within expected timeframes)

#### Examples:
- Checking if any contaminant are missing calculated isotope ratios baed on Raliegh equation exist for isoptoppe analysis. 
- Validating all the concentration values are positive numbers.  

- Monitoring real-time streaming data for sudden spikes in API errors (if we want to recive redox data of Grift park constructed wetlan from online server)

## 6. Data Analytics & Delivery (Insights & Output)
At this stage, we extract insights from processed data, either through graphs or reports.

### Examples:
- Graph: Visualize na_analysis data as traffic lights plotted for each sample
- Graph: creat Rayleigh plots
- Reports: prepare TAUW report
- APIs that serve the processed data to other services or researchers


## End-to-End Example of the Data Pipeline

After [installing mibipret](../index.md), the following python code can be executed from the root directory of the mibipret repository.

### 1. Ingestion:

```python
from mibipret.data.load_data import load_csv
from mibipret.data.load_data import load_excel

# load data from csv file
griftpark_file_path = "./examples/ex01_Griftpark/grift_BTEXIIN.csv
data_raw,units = load_csv(griftpark_file_path,verbose=False)

# load data from excel file per sheet 
amersfoort_file_path = "./examples/ex02_Amersfoort/amersfoort.xlsx
environment_raw,units = load_excel(amersfoort_file_path, sheet_name = 'environment', verbose = False)
```
    
### 2. Preprocessing:(Cleaning and Standardization)
Runs all checks on data, i.e. column names (check_columns()), data format (check_data_frame()), units (check_units()), names (standard_names()) and values (check_values()) in one go and returns transformed data with standard column names and valueas in numerical type where possible. Data is reduced to those columns containing known quantities if reduce=true.

```Python
from mibipret.data.check_data import standardize
data, units = standardize(data_raw, reduce = True, verbose=False)
```

### 3. Transformation:(processing and enrichment)
For NA screening, stochiometric equations are used to analyze electron balance, here is how to perform NA screening step by step:
#### Calculation of number of electrons for reduction
Returns pandas-Series with total amount of electron reductors per well in [mmol e-/l]:
```python
import mibipret.analysis.sample.screening_NA as na
tot_reduct = na.reductors(data,verbose = True,ea_group = 'ONSFe')
```

#### Calculation of number of electrons needed for oxidation
Returns pandas-Series with total amount of oxidators per well in [mmol e-/l]:

```python
tot_oxi = na.oxidators(data,verbose = True, contaminant_group='BTEXIIN')
```

#### Calculation of number of electron balance
Returns pandas-Series with ratio of reductors to oxidators. If value below 1, available electrons for reduction are not sufficient for reaction and thus NA is potentially not taking place:
```python
e_bal = na.electron_balance(data,verbose = True)
```
### Evaluation of intervention threshold exceedance
#### Calculation of total concentration of contaminants/specified group of contaminants
Returns pandas-Series with total concentrations of contaminants per well in [ug/l]:
```python
tot_cont = na.total_contaminant_concentration(data,verbose = True,contaminant_group='BTEXIIN')
```
If you want to perform complete NA screening and evaluation of intervention threshold exceedance in one go:
```python
data_na = na.screening_NA(data,verbose = True)
```
It is also possible to run full NA screening with results added to data using argument (inplace = True):
```python
na.screening_NA(data,inplace = True,verbose = False)
```
### 4. Storage:

!!! Warning
    Mibipret does not have support for file storage

### 5. Validation & Monitoring for Each Data Analysis Module
 we use the `options` function to check what types of analyses/modeling/visualization/reports we can do on the dataset
if func argument is provided, it will check whether this function is possible and if not what else is needed

!!! Warning
    This is intended behaviour but has not been implemented yet.

```python
mibipret.decision_support.options(st_sample_data, func=mibipret.visualize.traffic3d)

# To perform mibipret.visualize.traffic3d you need to run mibipret.analysis.na_screening
# the workflow requires the following columns: [x,y, depth]
# Row 4-19 and 28-39 have these columns defined, you can apply the function on these rows.
```

### 6. Analytics:
#### Calculation of "traffic light" based on electron balance
Returns pandas-Series with traffic light (red/yellow/green) if NA is taking place based on electron balance. Red corresponds to a electron balance below 1 where available electrons for reduction are not sufficient and thus NA is potentially not taking place:

```python
na_traffic = na.NA_traffic(data,verbose = True)
```
#### Calculation of "traffic light" for threshold exceedance
Returns pandas-DataFrame (similar to input data, including well specification) with intervention threshold exceedance analysis:
traffic light if well requires intervention (red/yellow/green)
number of contaminants exceeding the intervention value
list of contaminants above the threshold of intervention

```python 
na_intervention = na.thresholds_for_intervention(data,verbose = True,contaminant_group='BTEXIIN')
display(na_intervention)
```

#### Activity plot
Create activity plot linking contaminant concentration to metabolite occurence based on NA screening.

```python 
from mibipret.visualize.activity import activity
fig, ax = activity(data)
```

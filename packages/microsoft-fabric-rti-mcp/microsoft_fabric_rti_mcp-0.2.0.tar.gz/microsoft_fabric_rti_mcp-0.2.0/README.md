## üéØ Overview

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for [Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence (RTI)](https://aka.ms/fabricrti). 
This server enables AI agents to interact with Fabric RTI services by providing tools through the MCP interface, allowing for seamless data querying and analysis capabilities.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is in Public Preview and implementation may significantly change prior to General Availability.

### üîç How It Works

The Fabric RTI MCP Server acts as a bridge between AI agents and Microsoft Fabric RTI services:

- üîÑ **MCP Protocol**: Uses the Model Context Protocol to expose Fabric RTI capabilities as tools
- üèóÔ∏è **Natural Language to KQL**: AI agents can translate natural language requests into KQL queries
- üí° **Secure Authentication**: Leverages Azure Identity for seamless, secure access to your resources
- ‚ö° **Real-time Data Access**: Direct connection to Eventhouse and Eventstreams for live data analysis

### ‚ú® Supported Services

**Eventhouse (Kusto)**: Execute KQL queries against Microsoft Fabric RTI [Eventhouse](https://aka.ms/eventhouse) and [Azure Data Explorer (ADX)](https://aka.ms/adx).

**Eventstreams**: Manage Microsoft Fabric [Eventstreams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/eventstream/eventstream-introduction) for real-time data processing:
- List Eventstreams in workspaces
- Get Eventstream details and definitions

## üöß Coming soon
- **Activator**
- **Other RTI items**

### üîç Example Prompts

**Eventhouse Analytics:**
- "Get databases in my Eventhouse"
- "Sample 10 rows from table 'StormEvents' in Eventhouse"
- "What can you tell me about StormEvents data?"
- "Analyze the StormEvents to come up with trend analysis across past 10 years of data"
- "Analyze the commands in 'CommandExecution' table and categorize them as low/medium/high risks"

**Eventstream Management:**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install either the stable or Insiders release of VS Code:
   * [üí´ Stable release](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
   * [üîÆ Insiders release](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)
2. Install the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extensions
3. Install `uv`  
```ps
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```  
or, check here for [other install options](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_2)

4. Open VS Code in an empty folder


### Install from PyPI (Pip)
The Fabric RTI MCP Server is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/microsoft-fabric-rti-mcp/), so you can install it using pip. This is the easiest way to install the server.

#### From VS Code
    1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the command `MCP: Add Server`
    2. Select install from Pip
    3. When prompted, enter the package name `microsoft-fabric-rti-mcp`
    4. Follow the prompts to install the package and add it to your settings.json or your mcp.json file

The process should end with the below settings in your `settings.json` or your `mcp.json` file.

#### settings.json
```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "server": {
            "fabric-rti-mcp": {
                "command": "uvx",
                "args": [
                    "microsoft-fabric-rti-mcp"
                ],
                "env": {
                    "KUSTO_SERVICE_URI": "https://help.kusto.windows.net/",
                    "KUSTO_SERVICE_DEFAULT_DB": "Samples"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**: All environment variables are optional. The `KUSTO_SERVICE_URI` and `KUSTO_SERVICE_DEFAULT_DB` provide default cluster and database settings. The `AZ_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT` is only needed for semantic search functionality in the `kusto_get_shots` tool.

### üîß Manual Install (Install from source)  

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed properly and added to your PATH.
2. Clone the repository
3. Install the dependencies (`pip install .` or `uv tool install .`)

            }
        }
    }
}
```

## üêõ Debugging the MCP Server locally
Assuming you have python installed and the repo cloned:

### Install locally
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Configure

Follow the [Manual Install](#üîß-manual-install-install-from-source) instructions.

### Attach the debugger
Use the `Python: Attach` configuration in your `launch.json` to attach to the running server. 
Once VS Code picks up the server and starts it, navigate to its output: 
1. Open command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the command `MCP: List Servers`
2. Navigate to `fabric-rti-mcp` and select `Show Output`
3. Pick up the process ID (PID) of the server from the output
4. Run the `Python: Attach` configuration in your `launch.json` file, and paste the PID of the server in the prompt
5. The debugger will attach to the server process, and you can start debugging


## üß™ Test the MCP Server

1. Open GitHub Copilot in VS Code and [switch to Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)
2. You should see the Fabric RTI MCP Server in the list of tools
3. Try a prompt that tells the agent to use the Eventhouse tools, such as "List my Kusto tables"
4. The agent should be able to use the Fabric RTI MCP Server tools to complete your query


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The MCP server can be configured using the following environment variables:

### Required Environment Variables
None - the server will work with default settings for demo purposes.

### Optional Environment Variables

| Variable | Service | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `KUSTO_SERVICE_URI` | Kusto | Default Kusto cluster URI | None | `https://mycluster.westus.kusto.windows.net` |
| `KUSTO_SERVICE_DEFAULT_DB` | Kusto | Default database name for Kusto queries | `NetDefaultDB` | `MyDatabase` |
| `AZ_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT` | Kusto | Azure OpenAI embedding endpoint for semantic search in `kusto_get_shots` | None | `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/text-embedding-ada-002/embeddings?api-version=2024-10-21;impersonate` |
| `KUSTO_KNOWN_SERVICES` | Kusto | JSON array of preconfigured Kusto services | None | `[{"service_uri":"https://cluster1.kusto.windows.net","default_database":"DB1","description":"Prod"}]` |
| `KUSTO_EAGER_CONNECT` | Kusto | Whether to eagerly connect to default service on startup (not recommended) | `false` | `true` or `false` |
| `KUSTO_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_SERVICES` | Kusto | Security setting to allow connections to services not in `KUSTO_KNOWN_SERVICES` | `true` | `true` or `false` |
| `FABRIC_API_BASE` | Global | Base URL for Microsoft Fabric API | `https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1` | `https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1` |

### Embedding Endpoint Configuration

The `AZ_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT` is used by the semantic search functionality (e.g., `kusto_get_shots` function) to find similar query examples. 

**Format Requirements:**
```
https://{your-openai-resource}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment-name}/embeddings?api-version={api-version};impersonate
```

**Components:**
- `{your-openai-resource}`: Your Azure OpenAI resource name
- `{deployment-name}`: Your text embedding deployment name (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`)
- `{api-version}`: API version (e.g., `2024-10-21`, `2023-05-15`)
- `;impersonate`: Authentication method (you might use managed identity)

**Authentication Requirements:**
- Your Azure identity must have access to the OpenAI resource
- In case using managed identity, the OpenAI resource must should be configured to accept managed identity authentication
- The deployment must exist and be accessible

### Configuration of Shots Table
The `kusto_get_shots` tool retrieves shots that are most similar to your prompt from the shots table. This function requires configuration of:
- **Shots table**: Should have an "EmbeddingText" (string) column containing the natural language prompt, "AugmentedText" (string) column containing the respective KQL, and "EmbeddingVector" (dynamic) column containing the embedding vector of the EmbeddingText.
- **Azure OpenAI embedding endpoint**: Used to create embedding vectors for your prompt. Note that this endpoint must use the same model that was used for creating the "EmbeddingVector" column in the shots table.

## üîë Authentication

The MCP Server seamlessly integrates with your host operating system's authentication mechanisms. We use Azure Identity via [`DefaultAzureCredential`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication/credential-chains?tabs=dac), which tries these authentication methods in order:

1. **Environment Variables** (`EnvironmentCredential`) - Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
2. **Visual Studio** (`VisualStudioCredential`) - Uses your Visual Studio credentials
3. **Azure CLI** (`AzureCliCredential`) - Uses your existing Azure CLI login
4. **Azure PowerShell** (`AzurePowerShellCredential`) - Uses your Az PowerShell login
5. **Azure Developer CLI** (`AzureDeveloperCliCredential`) - Uses your azd login
6. **Interactive Browser** (`InteractiveBrowserCredential`) - Falls back to browser-based login if needed

If you're already logged in through any of these methods, the Fabric RTI MCP Server will automatically use those credentials.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Note

Your credentials are always handled securely through the official [Azure Identity SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md) - **we never store or manage tokens directly**.

MCP as a phenomenon is very novel and cutting-edge. As with all new technology standards, consider doing a security review to ensure any systems that integrate with MCP servers follow all regulations and standards your system is expected to adhere to. This includes not only the Azure MCP Server, but any MCP client/agent that you choose to implement down to the model provider.

## About
CREDIT is an open software platform to train and deploy AI atmospheric prediction models. CREDIT offers fast models 
that can be flexibly configured both in terms of input data and neural network architecture. The interface is designed
to be user-friendly and enable fast spin-up and iteration. CREDIT is backed by the AI and atmospheric science expertise
of the MILES group and the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research, leading to design choices that balance advanced
AI/ML with our physical knowledge of the atmosphere.

CREDIT has reached its first stable release with a full set of models, training, and deployment options. It continues
to be under active development. Please contact [the MILES group](mailto:milescore@ucar.edu) if you have any questions about CREDIT.

MILES CREDIT also provides more detailed [documentation](https://miles-credit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with installation
instructions, how to get started training and deploying models, how to interpret the config files, and full API docs.

Processed ERA5 Zarr Data are available for download through Globus (requires free account) through the [CREDIT ERA5 Zarr Files](https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/2fc90d8f-10b7-44e1-a6a5-cf844112822e/overview) collection.

Scaling/transform values for normalizing the data are available through Globus [here](https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/c5a23e21-1bee-4d1e-bb59-77c5dcee7c76). 

CREDIT also supports realtime runs generated from deterministic [Google Cloud GFS files](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/noaa-public/gfs)
and raw cube sphere [GEFS files](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/noaa-public/gfs-ensemble-forecast-system).

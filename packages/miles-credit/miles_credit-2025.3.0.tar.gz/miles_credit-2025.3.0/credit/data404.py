    Using typing.TypedDict gives us several advantages:
      1. Single 'source of truth' for the type and documentation of each example.
      2. A static type checker can check the types are correct.

    Instead of TypedDict, we could use typing.NamedTuple,

    hourly data for one variable.

    When we're sampling data, we only want to load from a single zarr
    store; we don't want the samples to span zarr store boundaries.
    This lets us leave years out from across the entire span for
    validation during training.

    To do this, we segment the dataset by year.  We figure out how
    many samples we could have, then subtract all the ones that start
    in one year and end in another (or end past the end of the
    dataset).  Then we create an index of which segment each sample
    belongs to, and the number of that sample within the segment.

    Then, for the __getitem__ method, we look up which segment the
    sample is in and its numbering within the segment, then open the
    corresponding zarr store and read only the data we want with an
    isel() call.

    For multiple variables, we necessariy end up reading from multiple
    stores, but they're merged into a single xarray Dataset, so
    hopefully that won't cause a big performance hit.

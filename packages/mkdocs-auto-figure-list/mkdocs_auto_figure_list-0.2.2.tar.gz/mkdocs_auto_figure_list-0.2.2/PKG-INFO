# MkDocs auto figure list

**Note: This plugin is still in an early development phase and may contain some bugs. You are welcome to contribute to its further development.**

This plugin searches through all markdown files for the HTML tags `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`. These are then collected in ascending order, and a new markdown file named `figure-list.md` is created. This file lists all the figures and adds a link to the corresponding image.

This plugin works with the PDF-Exporter Plugin: https://github.com/Privatacc/mkdocs-to-pdf.git

Example of a `<figure>` tag:
```
<figure>
  <img src="path/to/img.jpg" alt="my image">
  <figcaption>My figcaption</figcaption>`
</figure>
```

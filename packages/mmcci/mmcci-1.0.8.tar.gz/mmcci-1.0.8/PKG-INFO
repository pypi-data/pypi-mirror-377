**MMCCI** is a fast and lightweight Python package for integrating and visualizing CCI networks. It works on **scRNA-seq** and **spatial transcriptomics** data samples that have been processed through CCI algorithms including [stLearn](https://stlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [CellChat](http://www.cellchat.org/), [CellPhoneDB](https://www.cellphonedb.org/), [NATMI](https://github.com/asrhou/NATMI), and [Squidpy](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

![Integration and Analysis Method](docs/images/analyses_pipeline.png)

## Getting Started

### Installation

MMCCI can be installed with `pip`

```
pip install mmcci
```

### Documentation

Documentation is available at the [Read the Docs](https://mmcci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## CCI Integration

MMCCI allows users to integrate multiple CCI results together, both:
1. Samples from a single platform (eg. Visium)
2. Samples from multiple platforms (eg. Visium, Xenium, CosMx, CODEX)

## CCI Analysis

MMCCI provides multiple useful analyses that can be run on the integrated networks or from a single sample:
1. Network comparison between groups with permutation testing
2. CLustering of LR pairs with similar networks
3. Clustering of spots/cells with similar interaction scores
4. Sender-receiver LR querying
5. GSEA pathway analysis

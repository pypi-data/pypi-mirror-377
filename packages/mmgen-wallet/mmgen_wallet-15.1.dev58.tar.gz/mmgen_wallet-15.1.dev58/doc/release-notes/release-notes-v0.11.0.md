### MMGen Version 0.11.0 Release Notes

#### Important new features:

 - Subwallets: 7538a94, d1b8aef, 82086c9 (see the [Subwallets][U] wiki page for
   additional information)

 - BIP69 ordering of transaction inputs and outputs: 6b2c138

 - Support for Microsoft Windows via MSYS2: dcab109, 13ab257 (see the
   [Install MMGen on Microsoft Windows][W] wiki page for complete
   information.  Windows users should note the following caveats:
     + no [autosigning][X] support
     + no [Monero wallet creation/syncing support][M] (due to password file
       descriptor issues with monero-wallet-cli)
     + due to unpredictable behavior of MSYS2's Python `getpass()`
       implementation, passwords containing non-ASCII symbols should be entered
       using the `--echo-passphrase` option or via a password file.  Otherwise,
       these symbols might end up being silently ignored.
     + Though MSYS2 support is well tested and considered stable, itâ€™s a new
       feature and other glitches might remain.  If you think you've found a
       bug, don't hesistate to file an issue at
       <https://github.com/mmgen/mmgen/issues>.

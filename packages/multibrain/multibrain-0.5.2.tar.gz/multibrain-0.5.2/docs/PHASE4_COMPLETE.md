# Phase 4: Store System Overhaul - Complete ✅

**Completion Date:** 2025-01-15

## Overview

Phase 4 of the Svelte 5 migration has been successfully completed. All four stores have been converted from traditional Svelte stores to modern .svelte.js files using runes, providing better performance and a cleaner API.

## Stores Converted

### 1. Config Store (`config.svelte.js`)
- **Previous:** Writable store with derived enabledLLMs
- **New:** Uses `$state` for reactive values with `$effect` for localStorage persistence
- **Key Features:**
  - Automatic persistence to localStorage when state changes
  - Singleton pattern with getters for reactive access
  - Maintained all existing methods (load, addLLM, updateLLM, removeLLM, setSummaryLLM, updateSettings)
  - `enabledLLMs` converted to `$derived` value

### 2. Queries Store (`queries.svelte.js`)
- **Previous:** Writable store with simple state management
- **New:** Uses `$state` for queries array and currentQuery
- **Key Features:**
  - Clean API with getters for reactive access
  - Maintains query history with MAX_HISTORY limit
  - All methods preserved (addQuery, updateQuery, addResponse, clearHistory, removeQuery)

### 3. Streams Store (`streams.svelte.js`)
- **Previous:** Complex writable store with derived queryComplete
- **New:** Uses `$state` with `$effect` for connection monitoring
- **Key Features:**
  - Connection monitoring with proper cleanup
  - Abort controller management for stream cancellation
  - Complex state management for multiple concurrent streams
  - `queryComplete` function for checking stream completion status

### 4. Toasts Store (`toasts.svelte.js`)
- **Previous:** Writable store with timeout management
- **New:** Uses `$state` with `$effect` for cleanup
- **Key Features:**
  - Automatic timeout cleanup on component unmount
  - Simple API for showing different toast types
  - Maintains auto-dismiss functionality

## Component Updates

All components have been updated to:
1. Import from `.svelte.js` files instead of `.js`
2. Use direct property access instead of `$` prefix
3. Work with the new reactive patterns

### Updated Components:
- `App.svelte`
- `ConfigModal.svelte`
- `ToastContainer.svelte`
- `LLMConfigForm.svelte`
- `ErrorBoundary.svelte`
- `ResponseContainer.svelte`
- `QueryResponseContainer.svelte`

## Key Patterns Implemented

### 1. Singleton Store Pattern
```javascript
function createStore() {
  let state = $state(initialValue);
  
  return {
    get state() { return state; },
    method() { /* modify state */ }
  };
}

export const store = createStore();
```

### 2. Effect with Cleanup
```javascript
$effect(() => {
  // Setup code
  
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code
  };
});
```

### 3. Derived Values
```javascript
export const derivedValue = $derived(
  store.items.filter(item => item.enabled)
);
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Performance:** Fine-grained reactivity with runes provides better performance
2. **Simplicity:** Direct property access is more intuitive than store subscriptions
3. **Type Safety:** Better TypeScript inference with runes
4. **Maintainability:** Cleaner code with less boilerplate
5. **Compatibility:** Maintained backward compatibility with existing API

## Testing Results

- ✅ All stores initialize correctly
- ✅ State persistence works as expected
- ✅ Reactive updates propagate to components
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Dev server runs without issues

## Next Steps

With Phase 4 complete, the next phases in the migration plan are:
- Phase 5: Performance Optimizations
- Phase 6: Advanced Features Implementation
- Phase 7-10: Testing, Documentation, Deployment, and Cleanup

The store system is now fully modernized and ready for the performance optimization phase.

    The exponential map takes a tangent vector in the Lie algebra so(3)
    and returns the corresponding rotation quaternion. This is the inverse
    operation of log().

    The exponential map is mathematically equivalent to converting an axis-angle
    representation to its corresponding quaternion.

    Args:
        tangent_vector: Tangent vector in so(3) (axis-angle representation)
                       The magnitude is the rotation angle, direction is the rotation axis

    Returns:
        Quaternion in [w, x, y, z] format representing the rotation

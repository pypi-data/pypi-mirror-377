    The logarithmic map takes a rotation and returns the corresponding
    tangent vector (axis-angle representation) in the Lie algebra so(3).
    This is the inverse operation of exp().

    The logarithmic map is mathematically equivalent to converting a quaternion
    to its axis-angle representation.

        q: Quaternion in [w, x, y, z] format representing a rotation

    Returns:
        Tangent vector in so(3) (axis-angle representation)
        The magnitude is the rotation angle, direction is the rotation axis

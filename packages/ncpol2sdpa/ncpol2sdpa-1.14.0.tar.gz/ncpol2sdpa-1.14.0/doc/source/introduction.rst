Ncpol2sdpa solves global polynomial optimization problems of either commutative variables or noncommutative operators through a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. The optimization problem can be unconstrained or constrained by equalities and inequalities, and also by constraints on the moments. The objective is to be able to solve large scale optimization problems. Example applications include:

- When the polynomial optimization problem is defined over commutative variables, the generated SDP hierarchy is identical to `Lasserre's <http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/S1052623400366802>`_. In this case, the functionality resembles the MATLAB toolboxes `Gloptipoly <http://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/software/gloptipoly/>`_, and, with the chordal extension, `SparsePOP <http://sparsepop.sourceforge.net/>`_.
- `Relaxations <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/peterwittek/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/Parameteric%20and%20Bilevel%20Polynomial%20Optimization%20Problems.ipynb>`_ of `parametric <http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/090759240>`_ and `bilevel <http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02099>`_ polynomial optimization problems.
- When the polynomials are over noncommutative operators, the generated SDP is a step in the Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy. The most notable example is calculating the `maximum quantum violation <http:/dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.010401>`_ of `Bell inequalities <http://peterwittek.com/2014/06/quantum-bound-on-the-chsh-inequality-using-sdp/>`_, also in `multipartite scenarios <http://peterwittek.github.io/multipartite_entanglement/>`_.
- `Nieto-Silleras <http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/16/1/013035>`_ hierarchy for `quantifying randomness <http://peterwittek.com/2014/11/the-nieto-silleras-and-moroder-hierarchies-in-ncpol2sdpa/>`_ and for `calculating maximum guessing probability <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/peterwittek/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/Optimal%20randomness%20generation%20from%20entangled%20quantum%20states.ipynb>`_.
- `Moroder <http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.030501>`_ hierarchy to enable PPT-style and other additional constraints.
- Sums-of-square (SOS) decomposition based on the dual solution.
- `Ground-state energy problems <http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/090760155>`_: bosonic and `fermionic systems <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/peterwittek/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/Comparing_DMRG_ED_and_SDP.ipynb>`_, Pauli spin operators. This methodology closely resembles the reduced density matrix (RDM) method.

The implementation has an intuitive syntax for entering problems and it scales for a larger number of noncommutative variables using a sparse representation of the SDP problem. Further details are found in the following paper:

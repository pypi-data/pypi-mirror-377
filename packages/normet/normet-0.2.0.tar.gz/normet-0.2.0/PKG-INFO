# normet-py
normet provides tools for environmental time-series analysis, including pollutant normalisation, weather de-trending, synthetic control methods (ASCM, ML-ASCM), placebo tests, uncertainty bands, and EMI/MET decomposition. Designed for air-quality research, causal inference, and policy evaluation.

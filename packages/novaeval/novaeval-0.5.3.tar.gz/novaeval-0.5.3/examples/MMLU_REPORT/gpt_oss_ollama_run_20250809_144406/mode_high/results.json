If the experiment were run without controlling for this factor, differences in exercise intensity among subjects could confound the comparison between fish\u2011oil and garlic capsules. Blocking on exercise intensity (e.g., low, moderate, high) ensures that each treatment group has a balanced representation of each intensity level, thereby reducing variability due to this known predictor.\n\n- **Sleep length** is reported to have no association with cholesterol level, so blocking on it would add unnecessary complexity without improving the experiment\u2019s precision.\n\n- **Cholesterol level** is the outcome variable; blocking on it would be inappropriate (you cannot block on the response you are measuring).\n\n- **Capsule type** is the experimental factor you want to compare, so it should not be used for blocking.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is **A: by blocking on exercise intensity**.",

Which is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school?\nA. Plan I\nB. Plan II\nC.

Thus the total sum of investments in the whole school is the same as the sum of investments of the 132 investors.\n\n---\n\n### Plan\u202fI  \n- Randomly samples 30 students from the entire 1,650.  \n- Computes the sample mean \\( \\bar{Y}_I \\) of the *whole* population (which includes many zeros).  \n- Estimates the total as \\( \\hat{T}_I = 1650\\,\\bar{Y}_I \\).\n\nBecause the sample mean is taken from a population that contains a large proportion of zeros, the sample variance of \\( \\bar{Y}_I \\) is relatively large. Consequently, the confidence interval for \\( \\hat{T}_I \\) is wide.\n\n---\n\n### Plan\u202fII  \n- Randomly samples 30 students *only from the 132 investors*.  \n- Computes the sample mean \\( \\bar{Y}_{II} \\) of the investors (there are no zeros in this sub\u2011sample).  \n- Estimates the total as \\( \\hat{T}_{II}=132\\,\\bar{Y}_{II} \\).\n\nSince the sub\u2011population has no zero observations, its variance is smaller. The standard error of \\( \\bar{Y}_{II} \\) is therefore smaller, and after multiplying by 132 the resulting confidence interval for the total is narrower than that obtained with Plan\u202fI.\n\n---\n\n### Variance comparison (illustrative)\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{T}_I)=1650^2\\,\\frac{\\sigma_Y^2(1-30/1650)}{30},\\qquad\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{T}_{II})=132^2\\,\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{inv}}^2(1-30/132)}{30},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\) is the variance of investment for the whole school and \\(\\sigma_{\\text{inv}}^2\\) is the variance among investors.  \nBecause zeros inflate \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\) relative to \\(\\sigma_{\\text{inv}}^2\\), \\(\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{T}_{II})\\) is usually much smaller than \\(\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{T}_I)\\).\n\n---\n\nTherefore Plan\u202fII provides a more precise (narrower confidence interval) and thus a better estimate of the total stock\u2011market investment of the school\u2019s students.  \n\n**Correct choice: B.**",

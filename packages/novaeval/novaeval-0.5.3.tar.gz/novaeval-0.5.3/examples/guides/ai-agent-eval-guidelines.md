## Introduction

Evaluating conversational AI agents is fundamentally different from evaluating single-turn Q&A systems. Agents operate in complex, multi-turn environments where they must:

- **Maintain context** across multiple conversation turns
- **Complete goals** that span several interactions
- **Handle interruptions** and topic changes gracefully
- **Utilize memory** effectively to provide personalized experiences
- **Maintain consistency** in personality and capabilities

This guide provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving AI agents using NovaEval's advanced evaluation capabilities.

## Understanding Agent Evaluation Challenges

### Traditional Evaluation vs. Agent Evaluation

| **Traditional Evaluation** | **Agent Evaluation** |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Single input → Single output | Multi-turn conversations |
| Static context | Dynamic, evolving context |
| Simple accuracy metrics | Complex behavioral metrics |
| Isolated responses | Conversation flow and coherence |
| No memory requirements | Memory and context retention |

### Key Challenges in Agent Evaluation

#### 1. **Context Complexity**
- Agents must track information across multiple turns
- Context can span different topics and time periods
- Memory limitations can cause context loss

#### 2. **Goal-Oriented Behavior**
- Users often have complex, multi-step objectives
- Goals may evolve during the conversation
- Success requires completing the entire user journey

#### 3. **Conversation Dynamics**
- Natural conversation flow and transitions
- Handling interruptions and topic changes
- Maintaining engagement and helpfulness

#### 4. **Consistency Requirements**
- Factual consistency across all turns
- Personality and tone consistency
- Capability consistency (not claiming abilities it doesn't have)

#### 5. **Memory Utilization**
- Remembering user preferences and past interactions
- Referencing previous conversation elements appropriately
- Long-term memory across sessions

## Setting Up Agent Evaluation

### 1. Installation and Setup

```bash
# Install NovaEval with agent evaluation capabilities
pip install "novaeval[agents]"

# Set up environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
```

### 2. Basic Agent Evaluation Setup

```python
from novaeval.agents import ConversationalAgentEvaluator
from novaeval.agents.types import ConversationThread, ConversationMessage, ConversationRole

# Initialize the evaluator
evaluator = ConversationalAgentEvaluator()

# Create a conversation thread
thread = ConversationThread(
    thread_id="example_001",
    goal="Assist user with technical support",
    messages=[
        ConversationMessage(
            role=ConversationRole.USER,
            content="My laptop won't start. Can you help?"
        ),
        ConversationMessage(
            role=ConversationRole.ASSISTANT,
            content="I'll help you troubleshoot your laptop. Let's start with some basic checks..."
        ),
        # ... more messages
    ]
)

# Run evaluation
result = await evaluator.evaluate_conversation_thread(thread, your_agent_model)
```

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems

#### For Noveum.ai Integration:
```python
from novaeval.integrations.noveum import NoveumAgentEvaluator

# Create evaluator with Noveum.ai integration
evaluator = NoveumAgentEvaluator(
    ai_gateway_logs_path="./ai_gateway_logs.jsonl",
    selected_thread_ids=["thread_001", "thread_002"]
)

# Evaluate against logged conversations
results = await evaluator.evaluate_logged_conversations()
```

#### For Custom Agent Frameworks:
```python
# Adapt your agent's conversation format
def convert_agent_conversation(agent_conversation):
    return ConversationThread(
        thread_id=agent_conversation.id,
        messages=[
            ConversationMessage(
                role=ConversationRole(msg.role),
                content=msg.content,
                timestamp=msg.timestamp
            ) for msg in agent_conversation.messages
        ]
    )
```

- **Session**: Information from the current conversation
- **Long-term**: Information from previous sessions
- **Preference**: User preferences and personalization

---

## Evaluation Methodologies

### 1. Retrospective Evaluation

Evaluate completed conversations to understand agent performance.

```python
# Evaluate a completed conversation thread
result = await evaluator.evaluate_conversation_thread(completed_thread)

# Analyze results
print(f"Overall Score: {result.overall_score:.3f}")
print(f"Goal Completed: {result.goal_completion_status}")

for metric, score in result.metric_scores.items():
    print(f"{metric}: {score:.3f}")
```

### 2. Real-time Evaluation

Monitor agent performance during live conversations.

```python
# Real-time evaluation during conversation
class RealTimeAgentMonitor:
    def __init__(self, evaluator):
        self.evaluator = evaluator
        self.current_thread = None

    async def on_message_received(self, message):
        self.current_thread.add_message(message)

        # Evaluate every few turns
        if len(self.current_thread.messages) % 4 == 0:
            partial_result = await self.evaluator.evaluate_conversation_thread(
                self.current_thread
            )

            # Alert if performance drops
            if partial_result.overall_score < 0.6:
                await self.trigger_intervention()
```

### 3. Simulation-Based Evaluation

Use synthetic users to test agent behavior systematically.

```python
from novaeval.agents.simulation import SyntheticUserSimulator

# Create synthetic user scenarios
scenarios = [
    {
        "user_persona": "frustrated_customer",
        "goal": "get_refund",
        "complexity": "high"
    },
    {
        "user_persona": "curious_learner",
        "goal": "learn_about_product",
        "complexity": "medium"
    }
]

# Run simulations
simulator = SyntheticUserSimulator()
for scenario in scenarios:
    conversation = await simulator.simulate_conversation(
        agent=your_agent,
        scenario=scenario,
        max_turns=10
    )

    result = await evaluator.evaluate_conversation_thread(conversation)
    print(f"Scenario {scenario['goal']}: {result.overall_score:.3f}")
```

### 4. A/B Testing for Agent Improvements

Compare different agent versions or configurations.

```python
# A/B test different agent configurations
async def ab_test_agents(agent_a, agent_b, test_scenarios):
    results_a = []
    results_b = []

    for scenario in test_scenarios:
        # Test Agent A
        conversation_a = await simulate_conversation(agent_a, scenario)
        result_a = await evaluator.evaluate_conversation_thread(conversation_a)
        results_a.append(result_a.overall_score)

        # Test Agent B
        conversation_b = await simulate_conversation(agent_b, scenario)
        result_b = await evaluator.evaluate_conversation_thread(conversation_b)
        results_b.append(result_b.overall_score)

    # Statistical analysis
    from scipy import stats
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(results_a, results_b)

    print(f"Agent A average: {np.mean(results_a):.3f}")
    print(f"Agent B average: {np.mean(results_b):.3f}")
    print(f"Statistical significance: p={p_value:.4f}")
```

## Interpreting Results

### Understanding Score Ranges

| **Score Range** | **Performance Level** | **Interpretation** |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 0.9 - 1.0 | Excellent | Agent performs exceptionally well |
| 0.8 - 0.9 | Good | Agent performs well with minor issues |
| 0.7 - 0.8 | Acceptable | Agent performs adequately but has room for improvement |
| 0.6 - 0.7 | Below Average | Agent has significant issues that need addressing |
| 0.0 - 0.6 | Poor | Agent requires major improvements |

### Metric-Specific Interpretation

#### Context Retention Score
- **High (0.8+)**: Agent consistently remembers and uses context
- **Medium (0.6-0.8)**: Agent sometimes forgets context or uses it inappropriately
- **Low (<0.6)**: Agent frequently loses context or ignores previous information

#### Goal Completion Rate
- **High (0.8+)**: Agent successfully completes most user objectives
- **Medium (0.6-0.8)**: Agent partially completes goals or requires multiple attempts
- **Low (<0.6)**: Agent frequently fails to achieve user objectives

#### Conversation Flow Quality
- **High (0.8+)**: Natural, smooth conversations with logical progression
- **Medium (0.6-0.8)**: Generally good flow with occasional awkward transitions
- **Low (<0.6)**: Choppy, unnatural conversations with poor transitions

### Turn-by-Turn Analysis

```python
# Analyze individual turns for detailed insights
for i, turn_score in enumerate(result.turn_by_turn_scores):
    print(f"Turn {turn_score['turn_number']}:")
    print(f"  Relevance: {turn_score['relevance']:.3f}")
    print(f"  Helpfulness: {turn_score['helpfulness']:.3f}")
    print(f"  Context Usage: {turn_score['context_usage']:.3f}")

    # Identify problematic turns
    if turn_score['overall'] < 0.6:
        print(f"  ⚠️ Low-performing turn - needs attention")
```

### Identifying Patterns

```python
# Analyze patterns across multiple conversations
def analyze_performance_patterns(evaluation_results):
    patterns = {
        "context_degradation": [],
        "goal_completion_failures": [],
        "consistency_issues": [],
        "flow_problems": []
    }

    for result in evaluation_results:
        # Check for context degradation over time
        turn_scores = [turn['context_usage'] for turn in result.turn_by_turn_scores]
        if len(turn_scores) > 3 and turn_scores[-1] < turn_scores[0] - 0.2:
            patterns["context_degradation"].append(result.thread_id)

        # Check for goal completion failures
        if not result.goal_completion_status:
            patterns["goal_completion_failures"].append(result.thread_id)

        # Check for consistency issues
        if result.metric_scores[AgentEvaluationMetric.CONSISTENCY] < 0.7:
            patterns["consistency_issues"].append(result.thread_id)

    return patterns
```

## Improvement Strategies

### 1. Context Retention Improvements

#### Problem: Agent forgets previous context
**Solutions**:
- **Improve memory architecture**: Implement better context summarization
- **Add explicit context references**: Train agent to explicitly reference previous information
- **Optimize context window usage**: Better prioritization of important context

```python
# Example: Context-aware prompt engineering
def build_context_aware_prompt(conversation_history, current_message):
    # Extract key context elements
    key_context = extract_key_information(conversation_history)

    prompt = f"""
    Previous conversation context:
    {key_context}

    Current user message: {current_message}

    Instructions: Reference relevant previous context in your response.
    """
    return prompt
```

#### Problem: Agent uses context inappropriately
**Solutions**:
- **Context relevance training**: Train on when to use vs. ignore context
- **Context validation**: Add checks for context appropriateness
- **Selective memory**: Implement mechanisms to forget irrelevant information

### 2. Goal Completion Improvements

#### Problem: Agent doesn't identify user goals correctly
**Solutions**:
- **Intent classification improvement**: Better training on intent recognition
- **Goal clarification prompts**: Ask clarifying questions when goals are unclear
- **Multi-step goal tracking**: Break complex goals into manageable steps

```python
# Example: Goal tracking system
class GoalTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_goals = []
        self.completed_goals = []

    def identify_goals(self, user_message):
        # Use NLP to extract potential goals
        potential_goals = extract_intents(user_message)
        for goal in potential_goals:
            if goal not in self.current_goals:
                self.current_goals.append(goal)

    def mark_goal_completed(self, goal):
        if goal in self.current_goals:
            self.current_goals.remove(goal)
            self.completed_goals.append(goal)
```

#### Problem: Agent starts tasks but doesn't complete them
**Solutions**:
- **Task persistence**: Maintain task state across turns
- **Progress tracking**: Monitor and report progress toward goals
- **Completion verification**: Confirm with user when tasks are completed

### 3. Conversation Flow Improvements

#### Problem: Awkward topic transitions
**Solutions**:
- **Transition phrase training**: Train on natural transition language
- **Topic modeling**: Better understanding of topic relationships
- **Flow planning**: Plan conversation structure in advance

```python
# Example: Smooth transition generation
def generate_transition(previous_topic, new_topic):
    transition_templates = {
        ("technical_support", "billing"): "Now that we've resolved the technical issue, let's address your billing question.",
        ("product_info", "purchase"): "Since you're interested in the product, would you like to proceed with a purchase?",
        # ... more templates
    }

    return transition_templates.get((previous_topic, new_topic),
                                  f"Moving on to {new_topic}...")
```

#### Problem: Repetitive or circular conversations
**Solutions**:
- **Conversation state tracking**: Monitor conversation progress
- **Repetition detection**: Identify and avoid repetitive responses
- **Progress indicators**: Show users how the conversation is advancing

### 4. Consistency Improvements

#### Problem: Contradictory information across turns
**Solutions**:
- **Fact checking**: Verify consistency with previous statements
- **Knowledge base integration**: Use consistent information sources
- **Contradiction detection**: Implement real-time consistency checking

```python
# Example: Consistency checker
class ConsistencyChecker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stated_facts = {}

    def check_consistency(self, new_statement):
        # Extract facts from new statement
        new_facts = extract_facts(new_statement)

        for fact in new_facts:
            if fact.subject in self.stated_facts:
                if self.stated_facts[fact.subject] != fact.value:
                    return False, f"Contradiction detected: {fact.subject}"
            else:
                self.stated_facts[fact.subject] = fact.value

        return True, "Consistent"
```

#### Problem: Inconsistent personality or tone
**Solutions**:
- **Personality guidelines**: Clear personality and tone guidelines
- **Style consistency training**: Train on maintaining consistent style
- **Tone monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of response tone

### 5. Memory Utilization Improvements

#### Problem: Agent doesn't remember user preferences
**Solutions**:
- **Preference extraction**: Automatically extract and store preferences
- **Personalization engine**: Use preferences to customize responses
- **Preference confirmation**: Confirm preferences with users

```python
# Example: Preference management
class PreferenceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_preferences = {}

    def extract_preferences(self, conversation_history):
        # Extract preferences from conversation
        preferences = {}
        for message in conversation_history:
            if message.role == ConversationRole.USER:
                extracted = extract_preferences(message.content)
                preferences.update(extracted)

        return preferences

    def apply_preferences(self, response, user_id):
        user_prefs = self.user_preferences.get(user_id, {})
        # Customize response based on preferences
        return customize_response(response, user_prefs)
```

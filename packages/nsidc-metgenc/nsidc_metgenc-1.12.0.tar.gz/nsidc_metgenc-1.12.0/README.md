The `MetGenC` toolkit enables Operations staff and data
producers to create metadata files conforming to NASA's Common Metadata Repository UMM-G
specification and ingest data directly to NASA EOSDIS’s Cumulus archive. Cumulus is an
open source cloud-based data ingest, archive, distribution, and management framework
developed for NASA's Earth Science data.

## Level of Support

This repository is fully supported by NSIDC. If you discover any problems or bugs,
please submit an Issue. If you would like to contribute to this repository, you may fork
the repository and submit a pull request.

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for details on permissions and warranties. Please contact
nsidc@nsidc.org for more information.

## Accessing the MetGenC VM and Tips and Assumptions
* from nusnow:
  `$ vssh staging metgenc`

* the one swell foop command line to kick off everything you need to run MetGenC:
  ```
  cd metgenc;source .venv/bin/activate;source metgenc-env.sh cumulus-uat;export EARTHDATA_USERNAME=<your uname>;export EARTHDATA_PASSWORD=<your pw>
  ```
Commands within the above one-liner detailed:
* CD Into and Activate the venv:

        $ cd metgenc
        $ source .venv/bin/activate

* Before you run end-to-end ingest, be sure to source your AWS credentials:

        $ source metgenc-env.sh cumulus-uat

  `cumulus-uat` is the profile you want to use from the `~/.aws/credentials` file.
  Available profiles are `cumulus-uat` and `cumulus-prod`.

  If you think you've already run it but can't remember, run the following:

            $ aws configure list

  The output will either indicate that you need to source your credentials by returning:

  ```
  Name                    Value             Type    Location
  ----                    -----             ----    --------
  profile             <not set>             None    None
  access_key          <not set>             None    None
  secret_key          <not set>             None    None
  region              <not set>             None    None
  ```
  or it'll show that you're all set (AWS comms-wise) for ingesting to Cumulus by
  returning the following:

  ```
  Name                         Value             Type    Location
  ----                         -----             ----    --------
  profile                 cumulus-uat             env    ['AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE', 'AWS_PROFILE']
  access_key     ****************SQXY             env
  secret_key     ****************cJ+5             env
  region                    us-west-2     config-file    ~/.aws/config
  ```



## Assumptions for netCDF files for MetGenC

* NetCDF files have an extension of `.nc` (per CF conventions).
* Projected spatial information is available in coordinate variables having
  a `standard_name` attribute value of `projection_x_coordinate` or
  `projection_y_coordinate` attribute.
* (y[0],x[0]) represents the upper left corner of the spatial coverage.
* Spatial coordinate values represent the center of the area covered by a measurement.
* Only one coordinate system is used by all data variables in all science files
  (i.e. only one grid mapping variable is present in a file, and the content of
  that variable is the same in every science file).

## MetGenC .ini File Assumtions
* A `pixel_size` attribute is needed in a data set's .ini file when gridded science files don't include a GeoTransform attribute in the grid mapping variable. The value specified should be just a number—no units (m, km) need to be specified since they're assumed to be the same as the units of those defined by the spatial coordinate variables in the data set's science files.
  * e.g., `pixel_size = 25`
* Date/time strings can be parsed using `datetime.fromisoformat`
* The checksum_type must be SHA256

## NetCDF Attributes MetGenC Relies upon to Generate UMM-G json Files
CF Conventions and NSIDC Guidelines (=NSIDC Guidelines for netCDF Attributes) are the driving forces behind emphatically
suggesting data producers include the Attributes used by MetGenC in their netCDF files.

- **Required** required
- **RequiredC** conditionally required
- **R+** highly or strongly recommended
- **R** recommended
- **S** suggested

| Attribute used by MetGenC (location in netCDF file)   | CF Conventions | NSIDC Guidelines | Notes   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| time_coverage_start (global)  |                | R                | 1, OC, P   |
| time_coverage_end (global)    |                | R                | 1, OC, P   |
| grid_mapping_name (variable)  | RequiredC      | R+               | 2       |
| crs_wkt (variable with `grid_mapping_name` attribute)      |  | R     | 3       |
| GeoTransform (variable with `grid_mapping_name` attribute) |  | R     | 4, OC   |
| geospatial_lon_min (global)   |                | R                | |
| geospatial_lon_max (global)   |                | R                | |
| geospatial_lat_min (global)   |                | R                | |
| geospatial_lat_max (global)   |                | R                | |
| geospatial_bounds (global)    |                | R                | 7, OC |
| geospatial_bounds_crs (global) |               | ?                | 8    |
| standard_name, `projection_x_coordinate` (variable) |  | RequiredC  |    | 5       |
| standard_name, `projection_y_coordinate` (variable) |  | RequiredC  |    | 6       |

Notes column key:

 OC = Optional configuration attributes (or elements of them) that may be represented
   in an .ini file in order to allow "nearly" compliant netCDF files to be run with MetGenC
   without premet/spatial files. See [Required and Optional Configuration Elements](#required-and-optional-configuration-elements)

 P = Premet file attributes that may be specified in a premet file; when used, a
  `premet_dir`path must be defined in the .ini file.

 1 = Used to populate the time begin and end UMM-G values; OC .ini attribute for
  time_coverage_start is `time_start_regex` = \<value\>, and for time_coverage_end the
  .ini attribute is `time_coverage_duration` = \<value\>.

 2 = A grid mapping variable is required if the horizontal spatial coordinates are not
   longitude and latitude and the intent of the data provider is to geolocate
   the data. `grid_mapping` and `grid_mapping_name` allow programmatic identification of
   the variable holding information about the horizontal coordinate reference system.

 3 = The `crs_wkt` ("coordinate referenc system well known text") value is handed to the
   `CRS` and `Transformer` modules in `pyproj` to conveniently deal
   with the reprojection of (y,x) values to EPSG 4326 (lon, lat) values.

 4 = The `GeoTransform` value provides the pixel size per data value, which is then used
   to calculate the padding added to x and y values to create a GPolygon enclosing all
   of the data; OC .ini attribute is `pixel_size` = <value>.

 5 = The values of the coordinate variable identified by the `standard_name` attribute
   with a value of `projection_x_coordinate` are reprojected and thinned to create a
   GPolygon, bounding rectangle, etc.

 6 = The values of the coordinate variable identified by the `standard_name` attribute
   with a value of `projection_y_coordinate` are reprojected and thinned to create a
   GPolygon, bounding rectangle, etc.

 7 = The `geospatial_bounds` global attribute contains spatial boundary information as a
   WKT POLYGON string. When present and `prefer_geospatial_bounds = true` is set in the
   .ini file, MetGenC will use this attribute instead of spatial coordinate values to generate
   the display GPolygon for collections with a GEODETIC granule spatial representation.
   If the `geospatial_bounds_crs` attribute is also present, coordinates
   will be transformed to EPSG:4326 if needed. The corresponding .ini parameter is `prefer_geospatial_bounds` = true/false.

 8 = The `geospatial_bounds_crs` global attribute specifies the coordinate reference system
   for the coordinates in `geospatial_bounds`. Can be an EPSG identifier (e.g., "EPSG:4326")
   or other CRS format. When present, MetGenC will transform coordinates to EPSG:4326 if needed.
   **If `geospatial_bounds` is `true` and no `geospatial_bounds_crs` attribute exists, the
   coordinates in the `geospatial_bounds` attribute are assumed to represent points in EPSG:4326.**

### How to query a netCDF file for presence of MetGenC-Required Attributes
On V0 wherever the data are staged (/disks/restricted_ftp or /disks/sidads_staging, etc.) you
can run ncdump to check whether a netCDF representative of the collection's files contains the
MetGenC-required attributes. When not reported, that attribute will have to be accommodated by
its associated .ini attribute being added to the .ini file. See [Required and Optional Configuration Elements](#required-and-optional-configuration-elements)
for full details/descriptions of these.
```
ncdump -h <file name.nc> | grep -e time_coverage_start -e time_coverage_end -e GeoTransform -e crs_wkt -e spatial_ref -e grid_mapping_name -e geospatial_bounds -e geospatial_bounds_crs -e 'standard_name = "projection_y_coordinate"' -e 'standard_name = "projection_x_coordinate"'
```

## Geometry Logic

The geometry behind the granule-level spatial representation (point, gpolygon, or bounding
rectangle) required for a data set can be implemented by MetGenC via either: file-level metadata
(such as a CF/NSIDC Compliant netCDF file), `.spatial` / `.spo` files, or
its collection-level spatial representation.

When MetGenC is run with netCDF files that are
both CF and NSIDC Compliant (for those requirements, refer to the table:
[NetCDF Attributes Used to Populate the UMM-G files generated by MetGenC](#netcdf-attributes-used-to-populate-the-umm-g-files-generated-by-metgenc))
information from within the file's metadata will be used to generate an appropriate
gpolygon or bounding rectangle for each granule.

In some cases, non-netCDF files, and/or netCDF files that are non-CF or non-NSIDC
compliant will require an operator to define or modify data set details expressed through
attributes in an .ini file, in other cases an operator will need to further modify the
.ini file to specify paths to where premet and spatial files are stored for MetGenC to use
as input files.

For granules suited to using the spatial extent defined for its collection,
a `collection_geometry_override=True` attribute/value pair can be added to the .ini file
(as long as it's a single bounding rectangle, and not two or more bounding rectangles).
Setting `collection_geometry_override=False` in the .ini file will make MetGenC look to the
science files or premet/spatial files for the granule-level spatial representation geometry
to use.

### Geometry Rules
|Granule Spatial Representation Geometry | Granule Spatial Representation Coordinate System (GSRCS) |
|--------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| GPolygon (GPoly) | Geodetic |
| Bounding Rectangle (BR) | Cartesian |
| Points | Geodetic |

### Geometry Logic and Expectations Table
```
.spo = .spo file associated with each granule science file defining GPoly vertices
.spatial = .spatial file associated with each granule science file to define: BR, Point, or data coordinates parsed from a science file (all of which are to be encompassed by a detailed GPoly generated by MetGenC)
```

| source | num points | GSRCS | error? | expected output | comments |
| ------ | ------------ | ---- | ------ | ------- | --- |
| .spo  |   any | cartesian | yes | | `.spo` inherently defines GPoly vertices; GPolys cannot be cartesian. |
| .spo   | <= 2 | geodetic | yes | | At least three points are required to define a GPoly. |
| .spo  | > 2 | geodetic | no | GPoly as described by `.spo` file contents. | |
| .spatial | 1 | cartesian | yes | | NSIDC data curators always associate a `GEODETIC` granule spatial representation with point data. |
| .spatial | 1 | geodetic | no | Point as defined by spatial file. | |
| .spatial | 2 | cartesian | no | BR as defined by spatial file. | |
| .spatial | >= 2 | geodetic | no | GPoly(s) calculated to enclose all points. | If `spatial_polygon_enabled=true` (default) and ≥3 points, uses optimized polygon generation with target coverage and vertex limits. |
| .spatial | > 2 | cartesian | yes | | There is no cartesian-associated geometry for GPolys. |
| science file (NSIDC/CF-compliant netCDF) | NA | cartesian | no | BR | min/max lon/lat points for BR expected to be included in global attributes. |
| science file (NSIDC/CF-compliant) | 1 or > 2 | geodetic | no | | Error if only two points. GPoly calculated from grid perimeter. |
| science file, non-NSIDC/CF-compliant netCDF or other format | NA | either | no | As specified by .ini file. | Configuration file must include a `spatial_dir` value (a path to the directory with valid `.spatial` or `.spo` files), or `collection_geometry_override=True` entry (which must be defined as a single point or a single bounding rectangle). |
| collection spatial metadata geometry = cartesian with one BR | NA | cartesian | no | BR as described in collection metadata. | |
| collection spatial metadata geometry = cartesian with one BR | NA | geodetic | yes | | Collection geometry and GSRCS must both be cartesian. |
| collection spatial metadata geometry = cartesian with two or more BR | NA | cartesian | yes | | Two-part bounding rectangle is not a valid granule-level geometry. |
| collection spatial metadata geometry specifying one or more points | NA | NA |  | | Not a known use case  |

## Running MetGenC: Its Commands In-depth

### help
Show MetGenC's help text:

        $ metgenc --help
        Usage: metgenc [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

          The metgenc utility allows users to create granule-level metadata, stage
          granule files and their associated metadata to Cumulus, and post CNM
          messages.

        Options:
          --help  Show this message and exit.

        Commands:
          info     Summarizes the contents of a configuration file.
          init     Populates a configuration file based on user input.
          process  Processes science files based on configuration file...
          validate Validates the contents of local JSON files.

* For detailed help on each command, run: `metgenc <command name> --help`:

        $ metgenc process --help

### init

The **init** command can be used to generate a metgenc configuration (i.e., .ini) file for
your data set, or edit an existing .ini file.
* You don't need to run this command if you already have an .ini file that you prefer
  to copy and edit manually (any text editor will work) to apply to the collection you're ingesting.
* If running metgenc init, the name of the new ini file you specify needs to include the `.ini` suffix.
```
metgenc init --help
Usage: metgenc init [OPTIONS]

  Populates a configuration file based on user input.

Options:
  -c, --config TEXT  Path to configuration file to create or replace
  --help             Show this message and exit
```

Example running **init**

    $ metgenc init -c ./init/<name of config file to create or modify>.ini

##### INI RULES:
* The .ini file's `checksum_type = SHA256` should never be edited
* The `kinesis_stream_name` and `staging_bucket_name` should never be edited
* `auth_id` and `version` must accurately reflect the collection's authID and versionID
* `log_dir` specifies the directory where log files will be written. Log files are named `metgenc-{config-name}-{timestamp}.log` where config-name is the base name of the .ini file and timestamp is in YYYYMMDD-HHMM format. The log directory must exist and be writable. If not specified, defaults to `/share/logs/metgenc`
* provider is a free text attribute where, for now, the version of metgenc being run should be documented
  * running `metgenc --version` will return the current version

#### Required and Optional Configuration Elements
Some attribute values may be read from the .ini file if the values
can't be gleaned from—or don't exist in—the science file(s), but whose
values are known for the data set. Use of these elements can be typical
for data sets comprising non-CF/non-NSIDC-compliant netCDF science files,
as well as non-netCDF data sets comprising .tif, .csv, .h5, etc. The element
values must be manually added to the .ini file, as none are prompted for
in the `metgenc init` functionality.

See this project's GitHub file, `fixtures/test.ini` for examples.

| .ini element           | .ini section | Attribute absent from netCDF file the .ini attribute stands in for | Attribute populated in UMMG | Note |
| -----------------------|-------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------| ---- |
| time_start_regex       | Collection    | time_coverage_start | BeginningDateTime | 1    |
| time_coverage_duration | Collection    | time_coverage_end   | EndingDateTime | 2    |
| pixel_size             | Collection    | GeoTransform        | n/a | 3    |

R = Required for all non-netCDF file types (e.g., csv, .tif, .h5, etc) and netCDF files missing
    the global attribute specified

1. This regex attribute leverages a netCDF's file name containing a date to populate UMMG files'
   TemporalExtent field attribute, BeginningDateTime. Must match using the named group `(?P<time_coverage_start>)`.
   * This attribute is meant to be used with "nearly" compliant netCDF files, but not other file types
   (csv, tif, etc.) since these should rely on premet files containing temporal details for each file.

2. The time_coverage_duration attribute value specifies the duration to be applied to the `time_coverage_start`
value to generate correct EndingDateTime values in UMMG files; this value is a constant that will
be applied to each time_start_regex value gleaned from files. Must be a valid
[ISO duration value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).
   * This attribute is meant to be used with "nearly" compliant netCDF files, but not other file types
   (csv, tif, etc.) since these should rely on premet files containing temporal details for each file.

3. Rarely applicable for science files that aren't gridded netCDF (.txt, .csv, .jpg, .tif, etc.); this
value is a constant that will be applied to all granule-level metadata.

#### Granule and Browse regex

| .ini element | .ini section | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| browse_regex  | Collection    | 1    |
| granule_regex | Collection    | 2    |
| reference_file_regex | Collection | 3 |

Note column:
1. The file name pattern identifying the browse file(s) accompanying single or multi-file granules. Granules
   with multiple associated browse files work fine with MetGenC! The default is `_brws`, change it to reflect
   the browse file names of the data delivered. This element is prompted for when running `metgenc init`.
3. The file name pattern to be used for multi-file granules to define a file name pattern to appropriately
   group files together as a granule using the elements common amongst their names.
   - This must result in a globally unique: product/name (in CNM), and Identifier (as the IdentifierType: ProducerGranuleId in UMM-G)
     generated for each granule. This init element value must be added manually as it's **not** included in the `metgenc init` prompts.
5. The file name pattern identifying a single file for metgenc to reference as the primary
   file in a multi-file granule. This must be specified whenever working with multi-file granules. This element
   is prompted for when running `metgenc init`.
   * In the case of multi-file granules containing a CF-compliant netCDF science file and other supporting files
     like .tif, or .txt files, etc., specifying the netCDF will allow MetGenC to parse it as it would any other CF-compliant
     netCDF file, making it so operators don't need to supply premet/spatial files.

##### Example 1: Use of `granule_regex` and `browse_regex` for a single-file granule with multiple browse images
Given the .ini file's Source and Collection contents:

```
[Source]
data_dir = ./data/0081DUCk

[Collection]
auth_id = NSIDC-0081DUCk
version = 2
provider = DPT
browse_regex = _brws
granule_regex = (NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_)(?P<granuleid>[NS]{1}\d{2}km_\d{8})(_v2.0_)(?:F\d{2}_)?(DUCk)
```
And two granules + their associated browse files:
```
NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_N25km_20211101_v2.0_DUCk.nc
NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_N25km_20211101_v2.0_F16_DUCk_brws.png
NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_N25km_20211101_v2.0_F17_DUCk_brws.png
NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_N25km_20211101_v2.0_F18_DUCk_brws.png
NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20211102_v2.0_DUCk.nc
NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20211102_v2.0_F16_DUCk_brws.png
NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20211102_v2.0_F17_DUCk_brws.png
NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20211102_v2.0_F18_DUCk_brws.png
```

The browse_regex:
This simply identifies the piece of the file names used to differentiate the browse image files from the science files, in this case: `browse_regex = _brws`.

The granule_regex sections:
- `(NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_)`, `(_v2.0_)`, and `(DUCk)` identify the 1st, 3rd, and 4th (the last) _Capture Groups_ to parse the constants to be included in each granule name: authID, version ID, and DUCk (the latter only relevant for early CUAT testing).

- The _Named Capture Group granuleid_ `(?P<granuleid>[NS]{1}\d{2}km_\d{8})` matches the region, resolution, and date elements unique to each file name to be included in each granule name, e.g., `N25km_20211101` and `S25km_20211102`.

- `(?:F\d{2}_)?` matches the F16_, F17_, and F18_ strings in the browse file names, to acknowledge their existence so the regex will work appropriately with all files in the collection BUT the `(?:F\d{2}_)?` represents a _Non-capture Group_; these elements will be matched but won't be included in the granule name.

- Thus, NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_, \_v2.0_, and DUCk will be combined with the granuleid capture group element to become the producerGranuleId reflected for each granule in EDSC's Granules listing. This will globally, uniquely identify all granules associated with a given collection from any other files in other collections in CUAT or CPROD. In this case that's `NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_N25km_20211105_v2.0_DUCk.nc` and `NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20211102_v2.0_DUCk.nc`. These are reflected in the CNM as the product/name value, and the UMMG as the Identifier value.

##### Example 2: Use of granule_regex for a multi-file granule with no browse

Given the Config file Source and Collection contents:

```
[Source]
data_dir = data/IPFLT1B_DUCk
premet_dir = premet/ipflt1b
spatial_dir = spatial/ipflt1b

[Collection]
auth_id = IPFLT1B_DUCk
version = 1
provider = OIB; metgenc version 1.10.0rc0
granule_regex = (IPFLT1B_)(?P<granuleid>.+?(?=_)_)?(DUCk)
reference_file_regex = _DUCk.kml
```
And a multi-file granule comprising the following files:
```
IPFLT1B_20101226_085033_DUCk.dbf
IPFLT1B_20101226_085033_DUCk.kml
IPFLT1B_20101226_085033_DUCk.shp
IPFLT1B_20101226_085033_DUCk.shx
IPFLT1B_20101226_085033_DUCk.txt
```
The granule_regex sections:

- `(IPFLT1B_)`, and `(DUCk)` identify the 1st and 3rd (the last) _Capture Groups_ to parse the constants to be included in each granule name: authID, and DUCk.

- The _Named Capture Group granuleid_ `(?P<granuleid>.+?(?=_)_)?` matches the unique date range contained in each file name to be included in each granule name, e.g., `IPFLT1B_20101226_085033_`.

- Thus, IPFLT1B_ and DUCk are combined with the granuleid capture group element to become the producerGranuleId reflected for each granule in EDSC's Granules listing. This will globally, uniquely identify all granules associated with a given collection from any other files in other collections in CUAT or CPROD. In this case that's `IPFLT1B_20101226_085033_DUCk`. This is reflected in the CNM as the product/name value, and the UMMG as the Identifier value.
Note: Ideally there would also be a version ID in this file name, but version wasn't assigned in most IceBridge collection granule names.

#### Using Premet and Spatial files
When necessary, the following two .ini elements can be used to define paths
to the directories containing `premet` and `spatial` files. The user will be
prompted for these values when running `metgenc init`.
| .ini element | .ini section |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| premet_dir    | Source        |
| spatial_dir   | Source        |

#### Setting Collection Spatial Extent as Granule Spatial Extent
In cases of data sets where granule spatial information is not available
by interrogating the data or via `spatial` or `.spo` files, the operator
may set a flag to force the metadata representing each granule's spatial
extents to be set to that of the collection. The user will be prompted
for the `collection_geometry_override` value when running `metgenc init`.
The default value is `False`; setting it to `True` signals MetGenC to
use the collection's spatial extent for each granule.
| .ini element                | .ini section |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| collection_geometry_override | Source        |

#### Setting Collection Temporal Extent as Granule Temporal Extent
RARELY APPLICABLE (if ever)!! An operator may set an .ini flag to indicate
that a collection's temporal extent should be used to populate every granule
via granule-level UMMG json to be the same TemporalExtent (SingleDateTime or
BeginningDateTime and EndingDateTime) as what's defined for the collection.
In other words, every granule in a collection would display the same start
and end times in EDSC. In most collections, this is likely ill-advised use case.
The operator will be prompted for a `collection_temporal_override`
value when running `metgenc init`. The default value is `False` and should likely
always be accepted; setting it to `True` is what would signal MetGenC to set each
granule to the collection's TemporalExtent.

| .ini element                 | .ini section |
| ----------------------------- | --------------|
| collection_temporal_override  | Source        |

#### Spatial Polygon Generation
MetGenC includes optimized polygon generation capabilities for creating spatial coverage polygons from point data, particularly useful for LIDAR flightline data.

When a granule has an associated `.spatial` file containing geodetic point data (≥3 points), MetGenC will automatically generate an optimized polygon to enclose the data points instead of using the basic point-to-point polygon method. This results in more accurate spatial coverage with fewer vertices.

**This feature is optional but enabled by default within MetGenC. To disable or to change values**, edit the .ini file for the collection and add any or all of the following parameters and the values you'd like them to be. Largely the values shouldn't need to be altered, but should ingest fail for GPolygonSpatial errors, the attribute to add to the .ini file would be the `spatial_polygon_cartesian_tolerance`, and decreasing the coordinate precision (e.g., .0001 => .01).

**Configuration Parameters:**

| .ini section | .ini element                    | Type    | Default | Description |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Spatial       | spatial_polygon_enabled          | boolean | true    | Enable/disable polygon generation for .spatial files |
| Spatial       | spatial_polygon_target_coverage  | float   | 0.98    | Target data coverage percentage (0.80-1.0) |
| Spatial       | spatial_polygon_max_vertices     | integer | 100     | Maximum vertices in generated polygon (10-1000) |
| Spatial       | spatial_polygon_cartesian_tolerance | float | 0.0001  | Minimum distance between polygon points in degrees (0.00001-0.01) |

##### Example Spatial Polygon Generation Configuration
Example showing content added to an .ini file, having edited the CMR default vertex tolerance
(distance between two vertices) to decrease the precision of the GPoly coordinate pairs listed
in the UMMG json files MetGenC generates:
```ini
[Spatial]
spatial_polygon_enabled = true
spatial_polygon_target_coverage = 0.98
spatial_polygon_max_vertices = 100
spatial_polygon_cartesian_tolerance = .01
```
Example showing the key pair added to an .ini file to disable spatial polygon generation:
```ini
[Spatial]
spatial_polygon_enabled = false
```

**When Polygon Generation is Applied:**
- ✅ Granule has a `.spatial` file with ≥3 geodetic points
- ✅ `spatial_polygon_enabled = true` (default)
- ✅ Granule spatial representation is `GEODETIC`

**When Original Behavior is Used:**
- ❌ No `.spatial` file present (data from other sources)
- ❌ `spatial_polygon_enabled = false`
- ❌ Granule spatial representation is `CARTESIAN`
- ❌ Insufficient points (<3) for polygon generation
- ❌ Polygon generation fails (automatic fallback)

**Tolerance Requirements:**
The `spatial_polygon_cartesian_tolerance` parameter ensures that generated polygons meet NASA CMR validation requirements. The CMR system requires that each point in a polygon must have a unique spatial location - if two points are closer than the tolerance threshold in both latitude and longitude, they are considered the same point and the polygon becomes invalid. MetGenC automatically filters points during polygon generation to ensure this requirement is met.

This enhancement is backward compatible - existing workflows continue unchanged, and polygon generation only activates for appropriate `.spatial` file scenarios.

##### Geospatial Bounds Configuration

MetGenC can extract polygon vertices directly from the `geospatial_bounds`
NetCDF attribute when it contains a WKT POLYGON string. This extracts all
polygon vertices as individual points, providing an alternative to the default
of using spatial coordinate values to generate a polygon.
 **If no `geospatial_bounds_crs` attribute exists, the
`geospatial_bounds` value is assumed to represent points in EPSG:4326.**

**Example Configuration:**
```ini
[Spatial]
prefer_geospatial_bounds = true
```

**When Geospatial Bounds Extraction is Applied:**
- ✅ Granule spatial representation is `GEODETIC`
- ✅ `prefer_geospatial_bounds = true` in .ini file
- ✅ NetCDF file contains valid `geospatial_bounds` global attribute with WKT POLYGON

### info

The **info** command can be used to display the information within the configuration file as well as MetGenC system default values for data ingest.

```
metgenc info --help
Usage: metgenc info [OPTIONS]

  Summarizes the contents of a configuration file.

Options:
  -c, --config TEXT  Path to configuration file to display  [required]
  --help             Show this message and exit.
```

#### Example running info

```

* environment: reflects `uat` as this is the default environment. This can be changed on the command line when `metgenc process` is run by adding the `-e` / `--env` option (e.g., metgenc process -e prod).
* data_dir:, auth_id:, version:, provider:, local_output_dir:, and ummg_dir: (which is relative to the local_output_dir) are set by the operator in the config file.
* kinesis_stream_name: and staging_bucket_name: could be changed by the operator in the config file, but should be left as-is!
* write_cnm_file:, and overwrite_ummg: are editable by operators in the config file
  * write_cnm_file: can be set here as `true` or `false`. Setting this to `true` when testing allows you to visually qc CNM content as well as run `metgenc validate` to assure they're valid for ingest. Once known to be valid, and you're ready to ingest data end-to-end, this can be edited to `false` to prevent CNM from being written locally if desired. They'll always be sent to AWS regardless of the value being `true` or `false`.
  * overwrite_ummg: when set to `true` will overwrite any existing UMM-G files for a data set present in the vm's MetGenC venv output/ummg directory. If set to `false` any existing files would be preserved, and only new files would be written.
* checksum_type: is another config file entry that could be changed by the operator, but should be left as-is!
* number: 1000000 is the default max granule count for ingest. This value is not found in the config file, thus it can only be changed by a DUCk developer if necessary.
* dry_run: reflects the option included (or not) by the operator in the command line when `metgenc process` is run.
* premet_dir:, spatial_dir:, collection_geometry_override:, collection_temporal_override:,
  time_start_regex:, time_coverage_duration:, pixel_size:, browse_regex:, and granule_regex:
  are all optional as they're data set dependent and should be set when necessary by operators within the config file.

### process
```
metgenc process --help

Usage: metgenc process [OPTIONS]

  Processes science files based on configuration file contents.

Options:
  -c, --config TEXT   Path to configuration file  [required]
  -d, --dry-run       Don't stage files on S3 or publish messages to Kinesis
  -e, --env TEXT      environment  [default: uat]
  -n, --number count  Process at most 'count' granules.
  -wc, --write-cnm    Write CNM messages to files.
  -o, --overwrite     Overwrite existing UMM-G files.
  --help              Show this message and exit.
```
The **process** command can be run either with or without specifying the `-d` / `--dry-run` option.
* When the dry run option is specified _and_ the `-wc` / `--write-cnm` option is invoked, or your config
file contains `write_cnm_file = true` (instead of `= false`), CNM will be written locally to the output/cnm
directory. This promotes operators having the ability to validate and visually QC their content before letting them guide ingest to CUAT.
* When run without the dry run option, metgenc will transfer CNM to AWS, kicking off end-to-end ingest of
data and UMM-G files to CUAT.

When MetGenC is run on the VM, `metgenc process -d -c init/xxxxx.ini` must be run at the root of the vm's virtual environment, e.g., `vagrant@vmpolark2:~/metgenc$`. If you run it in the data/ or init/ or any other directory, you'll see errors like:
```
The configuration is invalid:
  * The data_dir does not exist.
  * The premet_dir does not exist.
  * The spatial_dir does not exist.
  * The local_output_dir does not exist.
```

If running `metgenc process` fails, check for an error message in the metgenc.log to begin troubleshooting.

#### Examples running process
The following is an example of using the dry run option (-d) to generate UMM-G and write CNM as files (-wc) for three granules (-n 3):

    $ metgenc process -c ./init/test.ini -d -n 3 -wc

This next example would run end-to-end ingest of all granules (assuming < 1000000 granules) in the data directory specified in the test.ini config file
and their UMM-G files into the CUAT environment:

    $ metgenc process -c ./init/test.ini -e uat
Note: Before running **process** to ingest granules to CUAT (i.e., you've not set it to dry run mode),
**as a courtesy to Cumulus devs and ops folks, post Slack messages to NSIDC's `#Cumulus` and `cloud-ingest-ops`
channels, and post a quick "done" note when you're done ingest testing.**


#### Troubleshooting metgenc process command runs
* If you run `$ metgenc process -c ./init/<some .ini file>` to test end-to-end ingest, but you
  get a flurry of errors, confirm that you completed the step to set up your AWS credentials
  _before_ running MetGenC:

  ```
  source metgenc-env.sh cumulus-uat
  ```

  where `cumulus-uat` reflects the desired profile name in `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials`.
  (Use `cumulus-prod` for the CPRD environment.)
  You can verify a successful AWS credential setup by running `aws configure list` at the prompt.
  Forgetting to set up communications between MetGenC and AWS is easy to do, but thankfully, easy to fix.

* When MetGenC is run on the VM, it must be run at the root of the vm's virtual environment, `metgenc`.

* If running `metgenc process` fails, check for an error message in the metgenc.log (metgenc/metgenc.log)
  to aid your troubleshooting.

### validate

The **validate** command lets you review the JSON CNM or UMM-G output files created by
running `process`.

```
metgenc validate --help

Usage: metgenc validate [OPTIONS]

  Validates the contents of local JSON files.

Options:
  -c, --config TEXT  Path to configuration file  [required]
  -t, --type TEXT    JSON content type  [default: cnm]
  --help             Show this message and exit.
```

#### Example running validate

    $ metgenc validate -c init/modscg.ini -t ummg (adding the -t ummg option will validate all UMM-G files; -t cnm will validate all CNM that have been written locally)
    $ metgenc validate -c init/modscg.ini (without the -t option specified, just all locally written CNM will be validated)

The package `check-jsonschema` is also installed by MetGenC and can be used to validate a single file at a time:

    $ check-jsonschema --schemafile <path to schema file> <path to CNM or UMM-G file to check>

### Pretty-print a json file in your shell
This is not a MetGenC command, but it's a handy way to `cat` a file and omit having
to wade through unformatted json chaos:
`cat <UMM-G or CNM file name> | jq "."`

e.g., `cat NSIDC0081_SEAICE_PS_S25km_20211104_v2.0_DUCk.nc.cnm.json | jq "."` will
pretty-print the contents of that json file in your shell!

If running `metgenc validate` fails, check for an error message in the metgenc.log to begin troubleshooting.

## For Developers
### Contributing

#### Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.12+
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

You can install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) either by using the [official
installer](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
if you’re comfortable following the instructions, or by using a package
manager (like Homebrew) if this is more familiar to you. When successfully
installed, you should be able to run:

    $ poetry --version
    Poetry (version 1.8.3)

#### Installing Dependencies

* Use Poetry to create and activate a virtual environment

      $ poetry shell

* Install dependencies

      $ poetry install

#### Run tests

    $ poetry run pytest

#### Run tests when source changes
This uses [pytest-watcher](https://github.com/olzhasar/pytest-watcher)

    $ poetry run ptw . --now --clear

#### Running the linter for code style issues

    $ poetry run ruff check

[The `ruff` tool](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/) will check
the source code for conformity with various style rules. Some of
these can be fixed by `ruff` itself, and if so, the output will
describe how to automatically fix these issues.

The CI/CD pipeline will run these checks whenever new commits are
pushed to GitHub, and the results will be available in the GitHub
Actions output.

#### Running the code formatter

    $ poetry run ruff format

[The `ruff` tool](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) will check
the source code for conformity with source code formatting rules. It
will also fix any issues it finds and leave the changes uncommitted
so you can review the changes prior to adding them to the codebase.

As with the linter, the CI/CD pipeline will run the formatter when
commits are pushed to GitHub.

#### Ruff integration with your editor

Rather than running `ruff` manually from the commandline, it can be
integrated with the editor of your choice. See the
[ruff editor integration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/) guide.


#### Releasing

* Update `CHANGELOG.md` according to its representation of the current version:
  * If the current "version" in `CHANGELOG.md` is `UNRELEASED`, add an
    entry describing your new changes to the existing change summary list.

  * If the current version in `CHANGELOG.md` is **not** a release candidate,
    add a new line at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` with a "version" consisting of
    the string literal `UNRELEASED` (no quotes surrounding the string).  It will
    be replaced with the release candidate form of an actual version number
    after the `major`, `minor`, or `patch` version is bumped (see below). Add a
    list summarizing the changes (thus far) in this new version below the
    `UNRELEASED` version entry.

  * If the current version in `CHANGELOG.md`  **is** a release candidate, add
    an entry describing your new changes to the existing change summary list for
    this release candidate version. The release candidate version will be
    automatically updated when the `rc` version is bumped (see below).

* Commit `CHANGELOG.md` so the working directory is clean.

* Show the current version and the possible next versions:

        $ bump-my-version show-bump
        1.4.0 ── bump ─┬─ major ─── 2.0.0rc0
                       ├─ minor ─── 1.5.0rc0
                       ├─ patch ─── 1.4.1rc0
                       ├─ release ─ invalid: The part has already the maximum value among ['rc', 'release'] and cannot be bumped.
                       ╰─ rc ────── 1.4.0release1

* If the currently released version of `metgenc` is not a release candidate
  and the goal is to start work on a new version, the first step is to create a
  pre-release version. As an example, if the current version is `1.4.0` and
  you'd like to release `1.5.0`, first create a pre-release for testing:

        $ bump-my-version bump minor

  Now the project version will be `1.5.0rc0` -- Release Candidate 0. As testing
  for this release-candidate proceeds, you can create more release-candidates by:

        $ bump-my-version bump rc

  And the version will now be `1.5.0rc1`. You can create as many release candidates as needed.

* When you are ready to do a final release, you can:

        $ bump-my-version bump release

  Which will update the version to `1.5.0`. After doing any kind of release, you will see
  the latest commit and tag by looking at `git log`. You can then push these to GitHub
  (`git push --follow-tags`) to trigger the CI/CD workflow.

* On the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nsidc/granule-metgen), click
  'Releases' and follow the steps documented on the
  [GitHub Releases page](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release).
  Draft a new Release using the version tag created above. By default, the 'Set
  as the latest release' checkbox will be selected. To publish a pre-release
  from a release candidate version, be sure to select the 'Set as a pre-release'
  checkbox. After you have published the (pre-)release in GitHub, the MetGenC
  Publish GHA workflow will be started.  Check that the workflow succeeds on the
  [MetGenC Actions page](https://github.com/nsidc/granule-metgen/actions),
  and verify that the
  [new MetGenC (pre-)release is available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nsidc-metgenc/).

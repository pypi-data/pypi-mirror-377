    - problem: "Find the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}"
      solution: "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nOkay, let me try to figure out the domain of this expression. The expression is a fraction with square roots in both the numerator and the denominator. So, I need to make sure that both of those square roots are defined and that the denominator isn't zero because you can't divide by zero.\n\nStarting with the numerator: \\(\\sqrt{x - 2}\\). For a square root to be defined, the inside has to be greater than or equal to zero. So, \\(x - 2 \\geq 0\\). Solving that gives \\(x \\geq 2\\). Got that part.\n\nNow the denominator: \\(\\sqrt{5 - x}\\). Similarly, the inside of this square root must be greater than or equal to zero. So, \\(5 - x \\geq 0\\). Solving that would give \\(x \\leq 5\\). But wait, there's another thing here. The denominator can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, \\(\\sqrt{5 - x}\\) can't be zero. When is that the case? If \\(5 - x = 0\\), then \\(x = 5\\). So, x can't be 5. Therefore, the denominator requires \\(5 - x > 0\\), which means \\(x < 5\\).\n\nPutting both conditions together: the numerator requires \\(x \\geq 2\\), and the denominator requires \\(x < 5\\). So, combining these two, the domain should be all real numbers where x is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 5. That interval would be written as \\([2, 5)\\).\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The numerator is okay as long as x is at least 2, and the denominator is okay as long as x is less than 5. There's no overlap or other restrictions, right? So yes, the domain should be \\([2, 5)\\).\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nTo find the domain of the expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}\\), we need to ensure both the numerator and the denominator are defined and that the denominator is not zero.\n\n1. **Numerator Condition**: The expression \\(\\sqrt{x - 2}\\) is defined when \\(x - 2 \\geq 0\\). Solving this inequality gives:\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Denominator Condition**: The expression \\(\\sqrt{5 - x}\\) is defined and non-zero when \\(5 - x > 0\\). Solving this inequality gives:\n   \\[\n   x < 5\n   \\]\n\nCombining these conditions, we need \\(x \\geq 2\\) and \\(x < 5\\). Therefore, the domain of the expression is the interval \\([2, 5)\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[2, 5)}\n\\]\n\n<|end_of_solution|>"

    - problem: "If $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$"
      solution: "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nOkay, so I need to find the determinant of the product of two matrices, A and B. The problem states that the determinant of A is 2 and the determinant of B is 12. I remember that there's a property in linear algebra related to the determinant of a product of matrices. Let me think... Oh right! The determinant of the product of two matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. So, \\(\\det(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = \\det(\\mathbf{A}) \\cdot \\det(\\mathbf{B})\\). That makes sense because determinants have multiplicative properties.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any conditions for this property. Like, does this hold for any two square matrices? I think so, as long as they are both n by n matrices. The problem doesn't specify the size of the matrices, but since determinants are only defined for square matrices, I can assume A and B are square and of the same size. So, multiplying them is valid, and their product will also be a square matrix of the same size.\n\nGiven that \\(\\det(\\mathbf{A})\\) is 2 and \\(\\det(\\mathbf{B})\\) is 12, multiplying them together should give \\(2 \\cdot 12 = 24\\). Therefore, the determinant of AB is 24. Let me just confirm with an example. Suppose A is a 2x2 matrix with determinant 2 and B is another 2x2 matrix with determinant 12. If I multiply them, the determinant of AB should indeed be 24. Yes, that works. So, the answer should be 24.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nGiven that the determinant of matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is 2 and the determinant of matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is 12, we need to find the determinant of the product \\(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}\\).\n\nWe use the property of determinants that states the determinant of the product of two square matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. Specifically, for any two square matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) of the same size, the determinant of their product is given by:\n\\[\n\\det(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = \\det(\\mathbf{A}) \\cdot \\det(\\mathbf{B})\n\\]\n\nApplying this property to the given matrices:\n\\[\n\\det(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = \\det(\\mathbf{A}) \\cdot \\det(\\mathbf{B}) = 2 \\cdot 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the determinant of the product \\(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}\\) is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).\n\n<|end_of_solution|>"

    - problem: "Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?"
      solution: "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nOkay, let me see. Terrell normally uses two 20-pound weights and does 12 lifts. First, I need to figure out the total weight he lifts in his usual routine. Each time he lifts, he's using two weights, so that's 20 pounds plus 20 pounds, right? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"two 20-pound weights\". So each weight is 20 pounds, and he lifts two of them each time. So each lift is 2 times 20 pounds. Then he does that 12 times.\n\nSo total weight lifted would be: number of lifts times weight per lift. The weight per lift is \\(2 \\text{weights} \\times 20 \\text{pounds each} = 40 \\text{pounds}\\). Then 12 lifts would be \\(12 \\times 40 = 480\\) pounds total.\n\nNow, if he switches to two 15-pound weights, each lift would be \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\) pounds. He wants to lift the same total weight, which is 480 pounds. So how many lifts does he need to do? Let me divide the total weight by the new weight per lift. So 480 divided by 30. Let me compute that: \\(\\frac{480}{30}\\). 30 times 16 is 480, right? Because \\(30 \\times 10=300\\), \\(30 \\times 5=150\\), so \\(30 \\times 15=450\\), plus 30 more is 480. So 16 lifts.\n\nSo the answer is 16. Let me just double-check. Original: \\(2 \\times 20 \\times 12 = 480\\). New: \\(2 \\times 15 \\times x = 30x\\). Set equal to 480, so \\(x = \\frac{480}{30} = 16\\). Yep, that's right.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nTerrell's usual routine involves lifting two 20-pound weights 12 times.  \n- **Total weight lifted**: \\(2 \\times 20 \\, \\text{lbs} \\times 12 = 480 \\, \\text{lbs}\\).  \n\nWith two 15-pound weights, the weight per repetition decreases:  \n- **New weight per repetition**: \\(2 \\times 15 \\, \\text{lbs} = 30 \\, \\text{lbs}\\).  \n\nTo lift the same total weight (480 lbs), the number of required repetitions is:  \n\\[\n\\frac{480 \\, \\text{lbs}}{30 \\, \\text{lbs/rep}} = 16 \\, \\text{reps}.\n\\]\n\nThus, Terrell must lift the 15-pound weights \\(\\boxed{16}\\) times.\n\n<|end_of_solution|>"

    - problem: "If the system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero."
      solution: "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the ratio a/b given that the system of equations has a solution where both x and y are nonzero. The equations are:\n\n\\(6x - 4y = a\\)\n\n\\(6y - 9x = b\\)\n\nHmm, so the problem is telling me that there exists some x and y (both not zero) that satisfy these two equations. Then I need to find \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\). Since they mentioned b is nonzero, I don't have to worry about division by zero here.\n\nFirst, maybe I can solve the system of equations for x and y in terms of a and b, and then find the ratio \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\). Alternatively, I can manipulate the equations to eliminate variables and find a relationship between a and b directly.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1) \\(6x - 4y = a\\)\n\n2) \\(-9x + 6y = b\\)  (I rearranged the second equation to make it clearer)\n\nWait, the second equation was originally \\(6y -9x = b\\). That's the same as \\(-9x +6y = b\\).\n\nNow, perhaps I can use the method of elimination. Let's try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's see if we can make the coefficients of x or y the same.\n\nLooking at equation 1: \\(6x -4y = a\\)\n\nEquation 2: \\(-9x +6y = b\\)\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, the coefficients of x would be 18 and -18, which might help eliminate x.\n\nMultiplying equation 1 by 3:\n\n\\(18x -12y = 3a\\)\n\nMultiplying equation 2 by 2:\n\n\\(-18x +12y = 2b\\)\n\nNow, if I add these two equations together:\n\n\\((18x -12y) + (-18x +12y) = 3a + 2b\\)\n\nSimplifying the left side: \\(0x + 0y = 3a + 2b\\)\n\nSo, \\(0 = 3a + 2b\\)\n\nWhich implies \\(3a + 2b = 0\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(3a = -2b\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{-2}{3}\\)\n\nWait, but let me check if this is valid. The problem states that the system has a solution where x and y are both nonzero. If the only way the system has a solution is if \\(3a + 2b = 0\\), then \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) must be \\(\\frac{-2}{3}\\). However, I need to confirm that there's actually a solution when \\(3a + 2b =0\\). If \\(3a +2b \\neq 0\\), the system would be inconsistent (since we'd have 0=non-zero), so no solution. Therefore, the condition for the system to have a solution is \\(3a +2b=0\\), so \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{-2}{3}\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve the system using substitution or another method. Let's try solving for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(6x = a +4y\\)\n\nSo, \\(x = \\frac{a +4y}{6}\\)\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2:\n\n\\(6y -9x = b\\)\n\n\\(6y - 9\\frac{a +4y}{6} = b\\)\n\nSimplify the \\(\\frac{9}{6}\\) to \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\):\n\n\\(6y - \\frac{3}{2}(a +4y) = b\\)\n\nMultiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\(12y -3(a +4y) = 2b\\)\n\n\\(12y -3a -12y = 2b\\)\n\nSimplify: \\(-3a =2b\\)\n\nSo, \\(3a = -2b\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{-2}{3}\\)\n\nSame result. So regardless of the method, we get \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{-2}{3}\\). Since the problem states that there exists a solution with x and y nonzero, this ratio must hold. So the answer is \\(\\frac{-2}{3}\\).\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nGiven the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n6x - 4y &= a, \\\n6y - 9x &= b,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwe need to find the ratio \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) given that the system has a solution where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are nonzero, and \\(b\\) is nonzero.\n\nFirst, we express \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\na = 6x - 4y\n\\]\n\\[\nb = -9x + 6y\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute the ratio \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{6x - 4y}{-9x + 6y}\n\\]\n\nFactoring the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{2(3x - 2y)}{-3(3x - 2y)}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are nonzero and \\(b\\) is nonzero, the term \\(3x - 2y\\) cannot be zero. Therefore, we can cancel \\(3x - 2y\\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{2}{-3} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\).\n\n<|end_of_solution|>"

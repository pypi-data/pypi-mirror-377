    !!! warning "Aborted multipart uploads"
        This function will automatically use [multipart
        uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html)
        under the hood for large file objects (whenever the length of the file is
        greater than `chunk_size`) or for iterable or async iterable input.

        Multipart uploads have a variety of advantages, including performance and
        reliability.

        However, aborted or incomplete multipart uploads can leave partial content in a
        hidden state in your bucket, silently adding to your storage costs. It's
        recommended to configure lifecycle rules to automatically delete aborted
        multipart uploads. See
        [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config.html)
        for the AWS S3 documentation, for example.

        You can turn off multipart uploads by passing `use_multipart=False`.

    Args:
        store: The ObjectStore instance to use.
        path: The path within ObjectStore for where to save the file.
        file: The object to upload. Supports various input:

            - A file-like object opened in binary read mode
            - A [`Path`][pathlib.Path] to a local file
            - A [`bytes`][] object.
            - An object implementing the Python [buffer
              protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html) (includes `bytes`
              but also `memoryview`, numpy arrays, and more). Note that only
              1-dimensional, contiguous, uint8-typed buffers are supported.
            - An iterator or iterable of objects implementing the Python buffer
              protocol.

    Keyword Args:
        mode: Configure the [`PutMode`][obstore.PutMode] for this operation. Refer to the [`PutMode`][obstore.PutMode] docstring for more information.

            If this provided and is not `"overwrite"`, a non-multipart upload will be performed. Defaults to `"overwrite"`.
        attributes: Provide a set of `Attributes`. Defaults to `None`.
        tags: Provide tags for this object. Defaults to `None`.
        use_multipart: Whether to use a multipart upload under the hood. Defaults using a multipart upload if the length of the file is greater than `chunk_size`. When `use_multipart` is `False`, the entire input will be materialized in memory as part of the upload.
        chunk_size: The size of chunks to use within each part of the multipart upload. Defaults to 5 MB.
        max_concurrency: The maximum number of chunks to upload concurrently. Defaults to 12.

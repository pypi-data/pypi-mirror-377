Use Cases / Context
===================

Without this module, Odoo is providing an AI solution that sends the
data to Odoo and Odoo to ChatGPT. There are strong concerns on this
topic about Data Protection.

For this reason, we defined a module that allows to integrate with your
Ollama instance.

Also, it can be an example of how to set other configurations, like a
direct connection to ChatGPT or other AI providers.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to create 2 parameters:

- *ai_oca_native_generate_ollama.connection*: Connection to your ollama
- *ai_oca_native_generate_ollama.model*: Model to use

Alternatively, you can add headers by using the parameter
\*ai_oca_native_generate_ollama.headers". It expects a dictionary.

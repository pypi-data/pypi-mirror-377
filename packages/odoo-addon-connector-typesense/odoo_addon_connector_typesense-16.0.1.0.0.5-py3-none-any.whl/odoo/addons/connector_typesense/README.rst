This package requires a typesense search engine running.
Please read this for a [quick docker based setup](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html#option-2-local-machine-self-hosting).

Configuration
=============

You have to configure (Host, Port, Protocol, Typesense API Key) in a new backend form view:

Search Engine > Configuration > Backends

Usage
=====

We recommend to use the typesense-dashboard for managing your typesense server.
I will allow you to configure the mapping of index with a nice UI.

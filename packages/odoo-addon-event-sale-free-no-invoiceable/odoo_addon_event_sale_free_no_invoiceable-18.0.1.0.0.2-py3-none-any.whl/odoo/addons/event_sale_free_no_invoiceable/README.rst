This module avoids that the sales orders containing only event tickets
lines with 0 price appear as invoiceable, making the "to invoice" list
very dirty.

Installation
============

When installing the module, all the existing ticket lines with 0 price
recomputes their invoice status, so in a huge DB it may take some time.

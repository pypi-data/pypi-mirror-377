This module adds a field *Reception Status* on purchase orders line. On
a confirmed purchase order line, it can have 3 different values:

- Nothing Received
- Partially Received
- Fully Received

Also takes this into account when computing the reception status for the
purchase order.

**Highly Recommended:** Install the ``purchase_order_line_menu`` module
to access the reception status field in the purchase order line tree
view for better visibility and management.

Usage
=====

If you are part of the *Purchase Manager* group, you can force a
confirmed purchase order to **Full Received** status: you have to check
the field **Force Received** located in the hidden fields on the tree
view (Order Lines tab).

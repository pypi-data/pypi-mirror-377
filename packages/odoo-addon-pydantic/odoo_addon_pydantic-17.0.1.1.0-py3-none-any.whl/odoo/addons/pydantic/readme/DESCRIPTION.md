This addon provides a utility method that can be used to map odoo record
to a [Pydantic model (>= v2)](https://docs.pydantic.dev/).

If you need to make your Pydantic models extendable at runtime, takes a
look at the python package
[extendable-pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/extendable_pydantic/) and
the [odoo addon extendable](https://pypi.org/project/odoo-addon-extendable)

This module allows configuring different paper formats for reports in a multi-company environment.

When a user creates a new company after this module is installed, the paper format for
reports will not be assigned automatically.
Users must manually assign the appropriate paper format for each report in the new company as 
necessary.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Odoo's standard behavior allows only a single paper format per report across all companies.
In a multi-company setup, this means it's not possible by default to use different paper
formats for each company.
This module addresses that limitation by enabling company-specific paper format
configuration.

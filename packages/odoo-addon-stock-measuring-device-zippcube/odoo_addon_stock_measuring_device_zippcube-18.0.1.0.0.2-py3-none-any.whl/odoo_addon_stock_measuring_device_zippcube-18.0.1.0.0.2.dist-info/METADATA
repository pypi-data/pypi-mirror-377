Different manufacturers produce devices which are able to measure and
weigh packages and parcels. Each brand has a different communication
protocol. This module provides an framework to interface such devices
with Odoo.

This module provides support for Bosche Zippcube devices.

Installation
============

To secure the communication, we use a pre-shared secret. Generate it
with a tool able to generate a random string, such as uuidgen. Run Odoo
with an environment variable called ZIPPCUBE_SECRET set to the value of
the secret.

After you have configured the measuring device in Odoo, you need to
configure the device itself.

Edit the language file on the computer attached to the device, and set
the following parameters (the secret value must be the one generated
earlier):

::

   REST_Body={"barcode":"%%VAR_NUMBER%%", "weight":"%%VAR_SCALE_WEIGHT%%",  "length":"%%VAR_LENGTH", "width":"%%VAR_WIDTH%%", "height":"%%VAR_HEIGHT%%", "secret": "<insert secret here>"}
   REST_BaseURL=http://<odoo_host_url>/stock/zippcube/<device_name>/measurement
   REST_ContentType=application/json
   REST_AcceptEncoding=gzip, deflate

For local testing you can use the script in scripts/measurement.sh

Configuration
=============

Create a measuring device with a type set to "zippcube".

Usage
=====

Use the "Wizard" button on a Measuring Device to open the screen and
take measurements.

After the measurement has been made, you need to click on the Refresh
button.

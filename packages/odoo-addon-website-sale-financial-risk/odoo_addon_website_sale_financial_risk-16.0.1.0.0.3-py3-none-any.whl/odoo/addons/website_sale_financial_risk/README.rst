Configuration
=============

Activate the ‘On credit’ payment provider and publish it on the website so that it is 
available in the order payment process.
Set a credit limit and configure financial risk settings as described in the 
account_financial_risk module.  
If the configuration has been set to display credit information on the portal, 
this information will also be displayed during the checkout process.

Usage
=====

Place an order in the online store. If you have credit available and the order 
amount does not exceed the available credit, you can place the order by selecting 
credit as the payment method.

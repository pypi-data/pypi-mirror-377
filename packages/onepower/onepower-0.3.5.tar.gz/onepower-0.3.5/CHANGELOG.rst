Legacy [13 Aug 2025]
--------------------

This is a realese of the code pre-modularisation and unification in a single package. It uses the framwork initially laid out by Maria Cristina Fortuna, by interfacing with CosmoSIS using multiple modules and passing data between them using the CosmosSIS datablock object.
We release this for legacy purposes and for us to more easily compare the changes and solve bugs that the mudularisation might have introduced.

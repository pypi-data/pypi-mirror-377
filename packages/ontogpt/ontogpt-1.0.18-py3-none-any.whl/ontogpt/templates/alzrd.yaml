title: Template for extracting Alzheimer's Disease Phenotypes
description: >-
  Template for extracting phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease and related
  dementias along with experimental metrics and model organisms.
  Assumes a large input text, on the order of a full scientific article or
  review. Focus is on extracting the methods and metrics used
  with different model organisms. This version of the template
  attempts to process the entirety of the input text at once.

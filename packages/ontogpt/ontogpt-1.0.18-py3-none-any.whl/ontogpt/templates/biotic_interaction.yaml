      prompt: >-
        A semi-colon separated list of taxon to taxon relationships, where
        each taxon is any plant or animal species or group, named by in the way
        it is defined in the input text. For example, "bear", "grass",
        "Ursoidea", "Halichoerus grypus", or "Panicum virgatum" are all
        valid taxon names. If a more specific name for
        either or both taxon is clear from the input text, it should be used,
        e.g., "Odocoileus virginianus sleeps on Panicum virgatum".
        Do not include interactions between a taxon and its environment
        or abiotic factors. If a location is specified, include it in the
        relationship, e.g., "deer eats grass in the forest".

    attributes:
      source_taxon:
        description: >-
          The taxon that is the subject of the interaction.
          This must be a name and cannot be a description of a taxon.
        range: Taxon
      target_taxon:
        description: >-
          The taxon that is the object of the interaction.
          This must be a name and cannot be a description of a taxon.
        range: Taxon
      interaction_type:
        description: >-
          The type of interaction between the source and target taxon.
          The relationship between each should be expressed
          in the present tense, e.g., if the input is "deer ate grass", the
          relationship should be "eats". For inputs like
          "mold is a colonizer of tree", the relationship should be
          "colonizes".
        range: InteractionType
      environment:
        description: >-
          The environment in which the interaction occurs.
          This should be a short description of the environment, e.g., "forest",
          "desert", "ocean", etc. If the environment is not specified, leave
          this field blank. The value here should be no more than a few words.

# TODO: Tune the anatomy extraction; it seems to miss many instances
# TODO: Try to be more specific about SNOMED terms, e.g., hemosiderin deposition
# grounds to SNOMEDCT:70748002 but that's specific to "Hemosiderin measurement, urine" 
# This may require instructions to reprocess the text to be more like SNOMED, e.g.,
# "hepatitis" doesn't have a specific term but maybe inflammation is appropriate

    description: >-
      A semicolon-delimited list of statements, each describing a pathology,
      including any diagnoses, one or more specific qualities being measured
      and the anatomical location or tissue the pathology is measured in. Each
      statement should describe a single condition.

          pathology, including any diagnoses, one or more specific qualities
          being measured and the anatomical location or tissue the pathology is

          negation should be included in each statement, e.g., "no granulomas or

          benign and/or if a carcinoma is explicitly excluded, this value should
          be true. A statement of "no significant pathologic abnormality"
          or the short form "nspa" would also have a value of true.

      location or tissue the pathology is measured in.

          The diagnosis or pathology being described. This may include
          full diagnoses or observations, for example, "colitis",
          "inflammation", "dysplasia", "polyp". If not specified, this value
          must be "Clinical finding". If a diagnosis cannot be reached
          (e.g., due to lack of tissue sample), this value must be
          "Clinical finding". Do not include qualifiers in this field,
          e.g., "active colitis" should be "colitis".

          Semicolon-delimited list of anatomical locations or tissues
          the pathology is measured in. This may need to be inferred from the

          A statement of "gastric antral-type mucosa" should be changed to
          include only the anatomical entity, in this case "gastric mucosa".

          Whether the pathology is negative or not present. This must be
          explicitly stated in the input, e.g., "no granulomas", in order
          to be true. It is otherwise false.

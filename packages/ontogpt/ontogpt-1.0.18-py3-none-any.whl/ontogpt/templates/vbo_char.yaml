      animal_names:
        range: AnimalName
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of names of animals
          used in the input text. These are general names,
          e.g., if any breed of cat is mentioned, this
          list should include "Cat breed", or for any pig,
          include "Pig breed".
      names:
        range: BreedName
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of names of animal breeds
          used in the input text. These should be as specific
          as possible about the breed of the animal.
          Examples include:
          Gimbsheimer Enten, Debao pony, Baixi
      characteristics:
        range: BreedToCharacteristic
        multivalued: true
        inlined: true
        inlined_as_list: true
        description: >-
          A semicolon-separated list of names of animal breeds
          used in the input text, along with a single characteristic
          mentioned for that breed. These should be as specific
          as possible about the breed of the animal. The characteristic
          may be color, dimensions, physical properties, abilities,
          or other features. Each statement should contain just one
          pair of breed name and characteristic.
          It should be formatted as
          "Breed IS Characteristic", or "Breed HAS Characteristic",
          e.g., Gimbsheimer Enten IS blue,
          Debao pony IS short,
          Baixi IS circular
          Each additional characteristic for a breed should get
          its own statement, e.g., "breed name is tall and wide"
          should become "Breed IS tall" and "Breed is wide".

        "is known today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by "

        "instead be made using validated clinical criteria or very rarely just confirmed "
        "by expert opinion. You will be told at the end of the case description whether "
        "a diagnostic test/tests are being ordered, which you can assume will make the "
        "diagnosis/diagnoses. After you read the case, I want you to give two pieces of "

        "not a broad category of answers. You do not need to explain your reasoning, just "
        "give the diagnosis/diagnoses. The second piece of information is to give a robust "
        "differential diagnosis, ranked by their probability so that the most likely "
        "diagnosis is at the top, and the least likely is at the bottom. There is no limit "
        "to the number of diagnoses on your differential. You can give as many diagnoses "
        "as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning, just list"
        " the diagnoses. Again, the goal is to be as specific as possible with each of the "
        "diagnoses. Do you have any questions, Dr. GPT-4?\n\nHere is the case:"

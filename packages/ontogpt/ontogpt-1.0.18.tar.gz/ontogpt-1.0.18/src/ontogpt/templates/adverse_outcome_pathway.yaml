  that link a molecular initiating event to an adverse outcome through a series of key events.

# TODO: Revisit treatment of AOP parts as NamedEntities - they may not always have unique identifiers

# TODO: Add functionality for extracting multiple, related AOPs from a single text,
#      e.g., multiple pathways for the same stressor or related pathways with shared key events

# TODO: process key event relationships

# TODO: Add Sex Applicability and Life Stage Applicability as attributes to AOPPathway
# this can include Evidence values too

# TODO: Add Taxonomic Applicability as an attribute to AOPPathway
# This includes a term (e.g., "human", "mouse", "rat") and/or a taxonomic group (e.g., "mammals", "birds")
# Plus evidence and a corresponding ncbitaxon ID if applicable

    attributes:
      aop_pathways:
        range: AOPPathway
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          A semicolon-delimited list of adverse outcome pathways extracted from the text.
          Each should take the form of free text describing the molecular initiating event
          (including the stressor), a sequence of key events, and the adverse outcome.
          For all events, include the biological target, event type, and biological context
          (for context, include the level of biological organization as well as any applicable
          cell types or organ types).
          Examples of event type include activation, inhibition, increase, decrease, impairment,
          agonism, antagonism, formation, alkylation, phosphorylation, failure, or occurrence.
          Examples of level of biological organization include molecular, cellular, tissue, organ,
          organism, individual, or population.
          If the molecular initiating event is not known, use "Unknown Initiator (UI)".
          Do not split onto new lines. Do not use semicolons unless separating
          multiple complete AOPs. Do not include a summary of the AOPs or any
          additional information not directly related to the AOPs.
          An example of a complete AOP pathway is: The molecular initiating event is formation of pro-mutagenic DNA Adducts. Key events are an increase in induced mutations in critical genes, metabolism of AFB1 and production of reactive electrophiles, clonal expansion and cell proliferation to form Altered Hepatic Foci (AHF), and an increase in insufficient repair or mis-repair of pro-mutagenic DNA adducts. The adverse outcome is tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

    description: A document that contains biological or biomedical concepts.
    is_a: TextWithTriples
    slot_usage:
      triples:
        range: ProteinToGORelationship
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semi-colon separated list of protein to GO term relationships,
            where the relationship is HAS ANNOTATION,
            for example:
            RPS7B HAS ANNOTATION structural constituent of ribosome;
            granzyme M HAS ANNOTATION endopeptidase activity;
            Mknk1 HAS ANNOTATION nucleoplasm

  ProteinToGORelationship:
    is_a: Triple
    description: >-
      A triple where the subject is a protein and the object is a GO term.
    slot_usage:
      subject:
        range: Protein
        description: >-
          The protein participating in the relationship,
          for example: Klp61F, GATA binding protein 3, S-formylglutathione
          hydrolase
      object:
        range: GOTerm
        description: >-
          The Gene Ontology term participating in the relationship,
          for example: cytosol, plasma cell differentiation, small-subunit
          processome
      predicate:
        range: ProteinToGOPredicate
        description: The relationship type, usually HAS ANNOTATION.
      subject_qualifier:
        range: NamedEntity
        description: >-
          An optional qualifier or modifier for the protein.
      object_qualifier:
        range: NamedEntity
        description: >-
          An optional qualifier or modifier for the GO term.

      A predicate for protein to GO term relationships.
    comments:
      - This may be changed to a more specific type, like RO
      - Any changes should be reflected for the triples slot in Document

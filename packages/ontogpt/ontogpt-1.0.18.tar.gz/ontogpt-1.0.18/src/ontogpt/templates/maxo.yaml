          Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease,

          the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of
          relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS
          or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included
          in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN
          disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug,
          include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example,
          "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".

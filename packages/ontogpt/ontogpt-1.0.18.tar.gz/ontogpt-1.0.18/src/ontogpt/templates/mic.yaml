        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of relationships
            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            feature, such as a disease, symptom, abnormality,
            or other health status. This may include diseases like
            Alzheimer's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus,
            rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell anemia, or Barth syndrome.
            It may also include phenotypes such as an observable
            physical or behavioral trait or symptom (e.g., fever,
            headache, short attention span, petechiae,
            telangiectasia). Do NOT include relationships concerning only 
            biological processes (e.g., "Insulin signaling" or "lipid
            metabolism"), developmental processes such as "limb development",
            or health states such as "healthy teeth".
            Provide the full text from the input text describing the relationship
            without changes or summarization. Include all numbered inline
            references contained in the sentences without changes.
            Do not include newlines. If multiple sentences describe the
            same relationship, include all of them.
            If the text describes a one-to-many relationship, include
            all of them separately. For example, "Vitamin A is associated with
            Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis (5,6)"
            should be "Vitamin A is associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (5,6);
            Vitamin A is associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis (5,6)".
            Use the same description of the relationship as in the input text.
            For example, if the input text states "Iron supplementation
            was shown to successfully treat anemia (5,6)", the output should be
            "Iron supplementation treats anemia (5,6)".
            Do not assign a relationship type. Retain the language used in the
            source text.
          prompt.examples: >-
            Evidence suggests that high-dose Vitamin A treatment may prevent Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (5,6). Further studies confirmed this finding (7); Studies have shown that Vitamin A is associated with bone cancer (8).

            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            biological process, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. A biological process is an
            activity or series of activities that occur in a
            cell or organism, such as "nuclear axial expansion",
            "intracellular transport", "ribosomal subunit export from nucleus",
            "insulin signaling", or "DNA repair".
            Biological processes do NOT include health states such as
            "healthy teeth" or proteins such as "retinoic acid receptor".
            Provide the full text from the input text describing the relationship
            without changes or summarization. Include all numbered inline

            Use the same description of the relationship as in the input text.

            "Vitamin A participates in Insulin Signaling (5,6)".
            Do not assign a relationship type. Retain the language used in the

            part or system of the body, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. Example parts or systems include
            "teeth", "skin", "cardiovascular system", "digestive system",
            or "liver". Transform names of processes
            to their respective anatomy, e.g., "thyroid function" or
            "thyroid health" should be changed to "thyroid"; "digestion"
            should be changed to "digestive system".
            Provide the full text from the input text describing the relationship
            without changes or summarization. Include all numbered inline
            references contained in the sentences without changes.

            Use the same description of the relationship as in the input text.
            For example, if the input text states "Vitamin A levels are

            "Vitamin A participates in the health of teeth (5,6)".
            Do not assign a relationship type. Retain the language used in the

            butter and apple (5,6)" should be "Vitamin A is associated with
            butter (5,6); Vitamin A is associated with apple (5,6)".
            These relationships may require some processing, e.g.,
            "Vitamin A is found in butter (5,6)" should be
            "Vitamin A is a nutrient of butter (5,6)".
          prompt.examples: >-

            and its receptor protein).
            Provide the full text from the input text describing the relationship
            without changes or summarization. Include all numbered inline

            Vitamin D (5,6); Vitamin A is associated with Vitamin E (5,6)".
            Use the same description of the relationship as in the input text.
            For example, if the input text states "Vitamin A participates in
            physiological processes with Vitamin D (5,6)", the output should be

          This value must be either "True" if
          the claim is negated or "False" if it
          is not. For example, "Vitamin A is not

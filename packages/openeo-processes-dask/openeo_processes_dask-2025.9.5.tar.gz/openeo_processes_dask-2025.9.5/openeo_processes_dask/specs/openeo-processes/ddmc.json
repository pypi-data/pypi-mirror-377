    "description": "Deep moist convection (DC) is associated with dangerous weather phenomena such as torrential rain, flash floods, large hail and tornadoes. The release of latent heat inside deep convective clouds often plays a crucial role. Studies have shown that DC and overshooting cloud tops penetrate into the lowest stratosphere and enable the exchange of gases from the troposphere deep into the stratosphere. The Sentinel satellites offer the possibility to monitor DC around the globe, independent of the emissivity of the ground. Detecting Deep Moist Convection is a combination of Deep Moist Convection, low- and mid-level cloudiness. \nThe `data` parameter expects a raster data cube with a dimension, by default, the dimension is the band dimension otherwise another `target_band ` must be specified. By default, the dimension must have at least five bands with the common names `nir08`, `nir09`, `cirrus`, `swir16` and `swir22` assigned. Otherwise, the user has to specify the parameters. The common names for each band are specified in the collection's band metadata and are *not* equal to the band names.\n\nBy default, the dimension of type `bands` is renamed by this process. To keep the dimension, specify a new band name in the parameter `target_band`. This adds a new dimension label with the specified name to the dimension, which can be used to access the computed values.",

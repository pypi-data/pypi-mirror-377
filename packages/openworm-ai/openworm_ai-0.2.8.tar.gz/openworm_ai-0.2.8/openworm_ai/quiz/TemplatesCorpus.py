You must generate exactly <QUESTION_NUMBER> multiple-choice questions **strictly based on the provided text**.  
If the text **does not contain enough information**, generate the remaining questions **using your own knowledge** on the topic.  

ðŸ”¹ **Rules:**  
- Prioritize document-based questions, but if the text lacks sufficient detail, rely on your own knowledge.  
- The questions should be **highly specific** and avoid generalizations.  
- If a topic is not covered in the text, only then use external knowledge.  
- Questions should challenge a **researcher or advanced student**.

QUESTION: <Insert question>  
CORRECT ANSWER: <Correct answer>  
WRONG ANSWER: <Wrong answer 1>  
WRONG ANSWER: <Wrong answer 2>

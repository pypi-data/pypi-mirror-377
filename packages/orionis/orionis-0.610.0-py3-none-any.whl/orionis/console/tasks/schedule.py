        """
        Wrap an asynchronous function to be executed in a synchronous context.

        This method creates a synchronous wrapper around an asynchronous function (coroutine)
        that enables its execution within non-async contexts. The wrapper leverages the
        Coroutine utility class to handle the complexities of asyncio event loop management
        and provides proper error handling with detailed logging and custom exception
        propagation.

        The wrapper is particularly useful when integrating asynchronous functions with
        synchronous APIs or frameworks that do not natively support async operations,
        such as the APScheduler job execution environment.

        Parameters
        ----------
        func : Callable[..., Awaitable[Any]]
            The asynchronous function (coroutine) to be wrapped. This function must be
            defined using the `async def` syntax and return an awaitable object. The
            function can accept any number of positional and keyword arguments.

        Returns
        -------
        Callable[..., Any]
            A synchronous wrapper function that executes the original asynchronous
            function and returns its result. The wrapper function accepts the same
            arguments as the original async function and forwards them appropriately.
            The return type depends on what the wrapped asynchronous function returns.

        Raises
        ------
        CLIOrionisRuntimeError
            If the asynchronous function execution fails or if the provided `func`
            parameter is not a valid asynchronous function. The original exception
            is wrapped to provide additional context for debugging.

        Notes
        -----
        This method relies on the Coroutine utility class from the orionis.services.asynchrony
        module to handle the execution of the wrapped asynchronous function. The wrapper
        uses the instance logger for comprehensive error reporting and debugging information.

            This wrapper provides a uniform interface for executing asynchronous functions within

            of managing async/await patterns and provides proper error handling with detailed logging

            *args : tuple
            Variable length argument list to pass to the wrapped asynchronous function.
            These arguments are forwarded directly to the original function.
            **kwargs : dict
            Arbitrary keyword arguments to pass to the wrapped asynchronous function.
            These keyword arguments are forwarded directly to the original function.

            Returns
            -------
            Any
            The return value from the executed asynchronous function. The type depends
            on what the wrapped function returns and can be any Python object.

            Raises
            ------
            CLIOrionisRuntimeError
            When the asynchronous function execution fails, wrapping the original

        Stop the scheduler synchronously by setting the stop event.

        event loop is running, the stop event is set in a thread-safe manner. Otherwise,
        the stop event is set directly.

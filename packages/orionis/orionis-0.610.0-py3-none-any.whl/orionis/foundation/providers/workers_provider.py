class WorkersProvider(ServiceProvider):
    """
    Service provider for worker management functionality within the Orionis framework.

    This provider is responsible for registering and configuring the worker management
    service implementation in the application's dependency injection container. It
    establishes the binding between the IWorkers interface contract and its concrete
    Workers implementation, enabling consistent worker operations throughout the
    application lifecycle.

    The provider follows the standard service provider pattern, offering both
    registration and boot phases for complete service lifecycle management.

    Attributes
    ----------
    app : Application
        The main application container instance used for service registration
        and dependency injection management.

    Notes
    -----
    This provider registers the worker service with transient lifetime, ensuring
    that each request for worker functionality receives a fresh instance. This
    approach is optimal for worker operations that may maintain temporary state
    or require isolation between different execution contexts.
    """

    def register(self) -> None:
        """
        Register the worker management service in the application container.

        This method registers the concrete Workers implementation as the service
        provider for the IWorkers interface contract. The service is configured
        as transient, meaning a new instance will be created each time it is
        requested from the container. The registration includes a descriptive
        alias for easy identification and retrieval.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs registration
            side effects on the application container.

        Notes
        -----
        The service is registered with transient lifetime, which means:
        - A new instance is created for each resolution request
        - No instance caching or singleton behavior is applied
        - Suitable for stateless or short-lived worker operations

        self.app.transient(IWorkers, Workers, alias=f"x-{IWorkers.__module__}.{IWorkers.__name__}")

    def boot(self) -> None:
        """
        Perform post-registration initialization for the worker management service.

        This method is called after all services have been registered in the container
        and provides an opportunity to perform any additional setup, configuration,
        or initialization logic that depends on other services being available.

        The boot phase occurs after the registration phase and allows for:
        - Cross-service dependency configuration
        - Service warm-up operations
        - Additional service binding or decoration
        - Runtime configuration validation

        Currently, this implementation serves as a placeholder with no specific
        initialization requirements for the worker service. Future enhancements
        may include worker pool initialization, background task setup, or
        performance monitoring configuration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method performs initialization side effects only and does not
            return any value.

        Notes
        -----
        This method is automatically called by the service provider framework
        during the application boot sequence. It should not be called manually
        in application code.

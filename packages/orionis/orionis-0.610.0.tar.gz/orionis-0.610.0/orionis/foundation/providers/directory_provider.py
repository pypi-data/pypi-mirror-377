class DirectoryProvider(ServiceProvider):
    """
    Service provider for registering the directory service in the application container.

    This provider binds the `IDirectory` interface to its concrete implementation (`Directory`)
    as a singleton. This ensures that a single shared instance of the directory service is
    available for dependency injection throughout the application.

    Attributes
    ----------
    app : Application
        The application container instance where services are registered.

    Methods
    -------
    register()
        Registers the directory service as a singleton in the application container.
    boot()
        Performs post-registration actions if necessary.

class ReactorProvider(ServiceProvider):
    """
    Service provider for worker management functionality within the Orionis framework.

    This provider is responsible for registering and configuring the worker management
    service implementation in the application's dependency injection container. It
    establishes the binding between the IReactor interface contract and its concrete
    Reactor implementation, enabling consistent reactor operations throughout the
    application lifecycle.

    The provider follows the standard service provider pattern, offering both
    registration and boot phases for complete service lifecycle management.

    Attributes
    ----------
    app : Application
        The main application container instance used for service registration
        and dependency injection management.

    Notes
    -----
    This provider registers the reactor service with a transient lifetime, ensuring
    that each request for reactor functionality receives a fresh instance. This
    approach is optimal for operations that may maintain temporary state or require
    isolation between different execution contexts.
    """

    def register(self) -> None:
        """
        Register the reactor management service in the application container.

        This method binds the IReactor interface to a new instance of the Reactor
        implementation within the application's dependency injection container. The
        service is registered with a transient lifetime, ensuring that each resolution
        yields a new Reactor instance. An alias is provided for convenient retrieval.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs registration
            as a side effect on the application container.

        Notes
        -----
        - Each call to resolve IReactor will produce a new Reactor instance.
        - No singleton or caching behavior is applied.
        - The alias "x-orionis.console.core.reactor" can be used for explicit lookups.
        """

        # Register the Reactor service with the application container
        # as a singleton, allowing it to be resolved throughout the application lifecycle
        self.app.singleton(IReactor, Reactor, alias=f"x-{IReactor.__module__}.{IReactor.__name__}")
    def boot(self) -> None:
        """
        Perform post-registration initialization for the reactor management service.

        This method is invoked after all services have been registered in the container.
        It provides an opportunity for additional setup, configuration, or initialization
        logic that may depend on other services being available. Currently, this method
        does not perform any actions but serves as a placeholder for future enhancements.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It only performs initialization
            side effects if required.

        Notes
        -----
        - Called automatically during the application boot sequence.
        - Intended for cross-service configuration or runtime setup.
        - No initialization is currently required for the reactor service.

        # No additional initialization required at this time

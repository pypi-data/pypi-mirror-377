class InspirationalProvider(ServiceProvider):
    """
    Service provider for registering inspirational services in the application container.

    The InspirationalProvider handles the registration and configuration of inspirational
    services within the application's dependency injection container. This provider follows
    the service provider pattern, ensuring that inspirational service implementations are
    properly bound to their corresponding contracts and made available for dependency
    injection throughout the application lifecycle.

    The provider manages the binding of the IInspire contract to its concrete Inspire
    implementation, configuring it as a transient service to ensure fresh instances
    are created for each resolution request.

    Attributes
    ----------
    app : Application
        The application container instance used for service registration and dependency
        injection management.

    Notes
    -----
    This provider inherits from ServiceProvider and implements the standard service
    provider lifecycle methods (register and boot) to properly integrate inspirational
    services into the application's service container architecture.
    """

    def register(self) -> None:
        """
        Registers the inspirational service in the application container.

        This method binds the `IInspire` contract to its concrete implementation `Inspire`
        as a transient service within the application's service container. Transient
        services are created each time they are requested from the container, ensuring
        fresh instances for each resolution. The service is also registered with an
        alias to enable convenient resolution and identification throughout the application.

        The registration establishes the dependency injection mapping that allows other
        parts of the application to receive the inspirational service implementation
        when requesting the `IInspire` interface.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method performs service registration as a side effect and does not
            return any value.

    def boot(self) -> None:
        """
        Executes post-registration initialization for the inspirational service.

        This method is called after all services have been registered in the
        application container and provides an opportunity to perform any additional
        setup, configuration, or initialization logic specific to the inspirational
        service. It follows the service provider lifecycle pattern where registration
        happens first, followed by booting for final setup tasks.

        The boot phase is particularly useful for operations that depend on other
        services being available in the container, cross-service configuration,
        or initialization of resources that require the complete service graph
        to be established.

        By default, this implementation performs no operations, but subclasses
        can override this method to implement custom initialization logic as
        required by specific use cases.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs initialization
            operations as side effects only.

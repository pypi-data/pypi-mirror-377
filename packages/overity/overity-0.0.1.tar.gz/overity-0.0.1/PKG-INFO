> **ðŸš§ Overity.ai is currently under heavy development. Initial release is planned for end of 2025. Leave a star to stay informed! ðŸš§**

Overity.ai is a open-source MLOps oriented framework for optimization,
qualification, and deployment of Edge-AI models in critical systems, focusing
on traceability and trustworthy AI.

It helps you organize training, optimization and validation methods, track
and version your datasets and models with complete traceability graphs, as well
as leveraging Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) testing to validate embedded use-cases.

Whether it's for local development or complex deployments in complete MLOps environments,
Overity.ai provides all the necessary tools to create the next ground-breaking Edge-AI
Revoluuuuuuuution! :smile:

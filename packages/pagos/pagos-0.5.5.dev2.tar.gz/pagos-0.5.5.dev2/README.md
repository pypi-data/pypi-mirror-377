# PAGOS
**P**ython **A**nalysis of **G**roundwater and **O**cean **S**amples (PAGOS) is a Python toolkit for creating and testing hydrological gas exchange models. Datasets from field campaigns containing data for a number of gas tracers can be used to optimise the parameters of gas exchange models, expressed as Python functions. These can be PAGOS' built-in models or user-defined.

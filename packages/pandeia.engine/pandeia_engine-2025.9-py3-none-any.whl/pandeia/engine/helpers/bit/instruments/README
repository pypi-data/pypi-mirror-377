THIS ENTIRE instruments DIRECTORY IS COPIED FROM THE pyetc REPO ON 20211020.
ORIGINAL CONTENT OF THIS FILE IS BELOW.  NOTES:
- the aptquery->pweb step does not require the instruments directory
- this directory is only required in pandeia for the pweb->peng step
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Web Refactoring: etc_instruments -> instruments

This package is installed as pyetc.instruments

Your instrument package will appear as pyetc.instruments.telescope.instrument_name

web code will appear as pyetc.instruments.telescope.instrument_name.web
	(this is not the current configuration, but will be)

engine code will appear as pyetc.instruments.telescope.instrument_name.engine

	** DO NOT assume that you can use 'pyetc.instruments.%s.%s.engine'
	** to find your engine code.

	DO use
		m = pyetc.main.tools.find_instrument('telescope','instrument')
		# returns a module/package
	to find your instrument engine package.

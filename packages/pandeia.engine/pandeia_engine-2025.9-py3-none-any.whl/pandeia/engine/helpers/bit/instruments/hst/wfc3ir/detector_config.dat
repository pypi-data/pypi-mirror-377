# This file contains attributes of the WFC3IR detector.
#
# These attributes are used at the time the detector
# object gets initialized. The code that handles this
# file lives in pyetc/engine/initialize.py
#
# These numbers are not to date, and are taken from the
# initial Java ETC file. These will need updating to match
# the numbers used by the ETC that we will be comparing to.
#
# The gain value below is also a hidden value in the web
# input form.

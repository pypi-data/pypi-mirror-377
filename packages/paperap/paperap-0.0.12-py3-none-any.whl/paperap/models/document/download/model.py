    Enum for document file retrieval modes.

    This enum defines the different ways a document can be retrieved from
    the Paperless-NgX server, each corresponding to a different endpoint
    and potentially different file format.

    Attributes:
        DOWNLOAD: Retrieve the full document file for downloading.

        THUMBNAIL: Retrieve a thumbnail image of the document.

    Represents a downloaded Paperless-NgX document file.

    This model stores both the binary content of a downloaded document file
    and metadata about the file, such as its content type and suggested filename.
    It is typically used as a return value from document download operations.

    Attributes:
        mode (RetrieveFileMode | None): The retrieval mode used (download, preview,
            or thumbnail). Determines which endpoint was used to retrieve the file.
        original (bool): Whether to retrieve the original file (True) or the archived
            version (False). Only applicable for DOWNLOAD mode.
        content (bytes | None): The binary content of the downloaded file.
        content_type (str | None): The MIME type of the file (e.g., "application/pdf").
        disposition_filename (str | None): The suggested filename from the
            Content-Disposition header.
        disposition_type (str | None): The disposition type from the Content-Disposition
            header (typically "attachment" or "inline").

        >>> # Download a document
        >>> doc = client.documents.get(123)

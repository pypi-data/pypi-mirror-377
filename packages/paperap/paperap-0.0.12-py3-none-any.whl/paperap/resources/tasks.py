"""
Resources for managing Paperless-NgX tasks.

This module provides classes and methods to interact with the Paperless-NgX task system.
It enables tracking, acknowledging, and waiting for asynchronous operations to complete.
Tasks are used for long-running operations like document uploads, OCR processing, and
bulk operations.

Classes:
    TaskStatus: Enum representing possible states of a task.
    TaskResource: Resource for interacting with the tasks API endpoint.

Example:
    >>> # Wait for a document upload task to complete
    >>> task_id = client.documents.upload_async("document.pdf")
    >>> task = client.tasks.wait_for_task(task_id)
    >>> print(f"Document {task.related_document} uploaded successfully")

Your task is to read, interpret, and summarize the document you are shown.

# Metadata
The document has the following metadata.
{% if document.title %}Current Title: {{ document.title }}{% endif %}
{% if tags %}
    Tags:
    {% for tag in tags %}
        {{ tag }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}

# Instructions
Analyze the document thoroughly and provide a structured summary of its contents. Focus on any keywords, topics, or unique features that will make it easier to search or categorize. Follow the guidelines below:

## Title
If the document itself has a title or heading, provide it (or propose one if none is explicitly given).
Keep the title concise and informative (5-10 words).

## Summary  
Summarize the main points, purpose, or subject of the document. Include any significant names, places, or events mentioned. Highlight critical pieces of information like dates, official references, or institutional data.

## Detailed Content  
Mention any relevant sections or headings in the document.
Transcribe critical text, such as signatures, official seals, letterheads, stamps, or other markings.
Note the style/tone of the document (formal, personal, procedural, etc.).
Identify if the document is handwritten, typed, printed, or a mix.
Note any institutional or archival markings, page numbering, or references to other documents.
If there are anomalies (e.g., torn pages, handwriting in margins, missing sections), mention them.
Provide any additional keywords not already in the text that could help with search or categorization.
Provide keywords that may be helpful for searchability which are not already present in the description. Include synonyms and related terms.

## Date Identification  
If the document contains an explicit date, format it as **YYYY-MM-DD**.
If no explicit date is found but an approximate era or year can be inferred (e.g., from letterheads, references, or known historical context), provide an estimate (e.g., "circa 1920s").
If no date can be determined, state "Date unknown."

## Tag Suggestions
Suggest tags for the image, if any apply. These tags are available to use:
arts and crafts, building interior, building exterior, children, award, black and white, color photo, candid

## Document Type
Classify the image as one of the following document types:
Photograph
Newspaper
Postcard
Blueprint
Letter
Receipt
Other

## Output Format
The output should be a JSON object with the following keys: title, summary, content, date, tags, and document_type. Do not include anything else in the output; just the JSON object.

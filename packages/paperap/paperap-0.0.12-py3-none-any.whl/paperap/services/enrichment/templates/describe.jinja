# Instructions
Analyze the image or document carefully and provide a detailed, structured description. Ensure your response is optimized for searchability by including specific keywords and contextual information.

## Title Suggestion
Provide a concise and relevant title that best describes the document in 5-10 words.
The title should be descriptive yet practical, ensuring it aids in quick identification.

## Detailed Description
Describe everything visible in the document, including:
- Visual elements (buildings, people, objects, clothing, signage)
- Text content (transcribe any visible text)
- Layout and format
- Context and purpose of the document
- Any notable details that would help identify this specific document

## Date Identification
If a date is visible anywhere in the document, extract and format it as YYYY-MM-DD.
If no explicit date is visible but an approximate time period can be inferred, provide an estimated date or decade (e.g., "circa 1920s").
If no date can be determined, state "Date Unknown."

## Tag Suggestions
Suggest tags for the document based on its content and type. Use existing tags when applicable:
{% for tag in tag_names %}
- {{ tag }}
{% endfor %}

## Custom Field Suggestions
Suggest values for these custom fields based on the document's content:
{% for field_name, field_value in custom_fields.items() %}
- {{ field_name }}: Currently "{{ field_value }}"
{% endfor %}

## Document Type
Classify the document as one of the following types:
Photograph, Letter, Invoice, Receipt, Report, Contract, Form, Certificate, Other

## Output Format
The output should be a JSON object with the following keys:
- title: Suggested title for the document
- description: Detailed description of the document contents
- date: Extracted or inferred date (YYYY-MM-DD format) or "Date Unknown"
- tags: Array of suggested tags

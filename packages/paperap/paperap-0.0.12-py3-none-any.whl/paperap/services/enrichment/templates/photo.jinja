{# 
  Photo description template for OpenAI vision models
  
  This template generates a prompt for OpenAI to analyze and describe images.
  It provides instructions for generating structured descriptions with specific
  elements like title, detailed description, date identification, tags, and document type.
  
  Variables:
    document: The Document object containing metadata about the image
    tag_names: Optional list of existing tags on the document
#}

Your task is to describe the photo you are shown.

# Metadata
The photo has the following metadata.
{% if document.title %}Current Title: {{ document.title }}{% endif %}
{% if tag_names %}
    Tags:
    {% for tag in tag_names %}
        {{ tag }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}

# Instructions
Analyze the image carefully and provide a detailed, structured description. Ensure your response is optimized for searchability by including specific keywords and contextual information.

## Title Suggestion
Provide a concise and relevant title that best describes the image in 5-10 words.
The title should be descriptive yet practical, ensuring it aids in quick identification.

## Detailed Description
Describe everything visible in the image, including buildings, people, objects, clothing, signage, and any other relevant elements.
Transcribe any text that appears in the image (e.g., signs, documents, nameplates, captions).
Describe the scene's atmosphere.
Identify whether the photo was taken indoors or outdoors, mentioning relevant background details.
Comment on the color tones (e.g., faded sepia, grayscale, vibrant, warm, sterile).
Emphasize anything that would stand out to a viewer and stick in their mind to distinguish this image from other photos. 
If inside, describe details of the room that may help identify where the photo was taken, such as furniture, wall decorations, windows, doors, and flooring.
Provide keywords that may be helpful for searchability which are not already present in the description. Include synonyms and related terms.

## Date Identification
If a date is visible anywhere in the image, extract and format it as YYYY-MM-DD.
If no explicit date is visible but an approximate time period can be inferred from clothing, architecture, or objects, provide an estimated decade (e.g., "circa 1920s"). If no date can be determined, state "Date Unknown."

## Tag Suggestions
Suggest tags for the image, if any apply. These tags are available to use:
arts and crafts, building interior, building exterior, children, award, black and white, color photo, candid

## Document Type
Classify the image as one of the following document types:
Photograph
Newspaper
Report
Postcard
Blueprint
Letter
Receipt
Other

## Output Format
The output should be a JSON object with the following keys: title, description, date, tags, and document_type. Do not include anything else in the output; just the JSON object.

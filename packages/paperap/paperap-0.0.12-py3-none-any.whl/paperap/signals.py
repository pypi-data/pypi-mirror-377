"""
Signal system for Paperap.

This module provides a flexible signal/event system that allows components to communicate
without direct dependencies. It supports prioritized handlers, handler chains, and
temporary handler disabling.

The signal system is designed around a singleton registry that manages all signals
and their handlers. Signals can be created, connected to, and emitted through this registry.

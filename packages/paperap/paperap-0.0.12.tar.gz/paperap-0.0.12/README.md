# Paperap

**Python library for interacting with the Paperless NGX REST API**

## Overview

Paperap (pronounced like "paperwrap") is a Python client library for interacting with the [Paperless-NGX](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) REST API. It provides an object-oriented interface for managing documents, tags, correspondents, and other resources within Paperless-NGX.

## Status

The library is in active development, and is not ready for production use.

## Features

- Authentication via API token or username/password
- Object-oriented interface with lazy-loaded querysets
- Pagination and filtering support
- Strongly typed models with Pydantic
- Intended to be easily integrated with existing Python applications

## Installation

```sh
pip install paperap
```

## Quick Start

Documentation: [https://paperap.readthedocs.io](https://paperap.readthedocs.io)

### Creating a Client

#### Using API Token:

```python
from paperap import PaperlessClient

client = PaperlessClient(
    base_url="https://paperless.example.com",
    token="your-token"
)
```

#### Using Username and Password:

```python
client = PaperlessClient(
    base_url="https://paperless.example.com",
    username="user",
    password="pass"
)
```

#### Loading Settings from Environment Variables:

Set the following environment variables:

- `PAPERLESS_BASE_URL`
- `PAPERLESS_TOKEN` or both `PAPERLESS_USERNAME` and `PAPERLESS_PASSWORD`

Then create a client without arguments:

```python
client = PaperlessClient()
```

## Working with Documents

### Listing Documents:

```python
for doc in client.documents.all():
    print(doc.title)
```

### Filtering Documents:

```python
docs = client.documents.filter(title__contains="invoice")
for doc in docs:
    print(doc.title)
```

### Getting a Single Document:

```python
doc = client.documents.get(123)
print(doc.title)
```

## Tags, Correspondents, and Other Resources

The same interface applies to other resources like tags, correspondents, and document types:

```python
for tag in client.tags.all():
    print(tag.name)
```

## Error Handling

Paperap raises exceptions for API errors:

- `PaperlessError` - Base exception
- `APIError` - Error when contacting the Paperless NGX API
- `AuthenticationError` - Error when authentication fails
- `ObjectNotFoundError` - Error when a single object is requested but not found
- `MultipleObjectsFoundError` - Error when a single object is requested but multiple objects are found

```python
from paperap.exceptions import ObjectNotFoundError

try:
    doc = client.documents.get(9999)  # Nonexistent document
except ObjectNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

```

## TODO
- [ ] increase test coverage (currently around 85%)
- [ ] Make integration tests easier to setup for other users (wip)
- [ ] Deleting tags, custom fields, etc via document.tags = None
- [ ] devcontainer (wip)
- [ ] cli tools (1 done)
- [ ] updating permissions, ownership, sharing, etc
- [ ] changing settings
- [ ] local queryset filtering on fields not supported by api
- [ ] unit tests for additional edge cases
- [ ] immutability (resources, response dicts, (optionally) for models)
- [ ] hypothesis testing (additional models)
- [ ] factories create relationships in db
- [ ] Lazy Document Evaluation after upload/download async
- [x] Remove validators that pydantic handles natively
- [x] factories create unique names
- [x] git action to distribute to pypi
- [x] batch editing
- [x] Empty trash
- [x] publish sphinx docs
- [x] Compile sphinx documentation
- [x] async model updates
- [x] uploading documents
- [x] raise errors for intuitive features unsupported by api (partially done)
- [x] enforce read-only fields
- [x] migrate to pytest
- [x] Replace yarl with pydantic urls
- [x] fetch each model synchronously and validate data types
- [x] lazy loading querysets
- [x] relationships between models using querysets
- [x] saving data to paperless
- [x] vscode tasks

## Known Bugs
- Looping over a queryset and deleting items will not modify the next page of the queryset
- Running unit tests and integration tests together causes errors, meaning something is not being cleaned up properly

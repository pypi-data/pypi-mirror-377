# Installation

## Requirements

Before installing Paperap, ensure you have:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- A running instance of Paperless-NgX (version 1.14.0 or later recommended)
- API access to your Paperless-NgX instance

## Installation Methods

### Using pip (Recommended)

The simplest way to install Paperap is through pip:

```bash
pip install paperap
```

If you prefer using a different package manager:

```bash
# Using pipx (isolated environment)
pipx install paperap

# Using uv (faster installation)
uv add paperap
```

## Next Steps

# Introduction to Paperap

Paperap is a modern, type-safe Python client for interacting with the [Paperless-NgX](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/) API. It provides a convenient and elegant interface to manage documents, tags, correspondents, and other resources in your Paperless-NgX instance.

## What is Paperless-NgX?

Paperless-NgX is a document management system that indexes your scanned paper documents and electronic documents. It processes documents through OCR (Optical Character Recognition), categorizes them, and makes them searchable, enabling you to create a paperless home or office.

## Why Paperap?

Paperap was created to provide a reliable, maintainable, and developer-friendly way to interact with Paperless-NgX programmatically. Whether you're building automation workflows, integrating with other systems, or just scripting common tasks, Paperap makes it easy to work with your documents.

## Features

- **Complete API Coverage**: Full support for all Paperless-NgX resources and operations
- **Type Safety**: Fully type-hinted with Pydantic models for reliable IDE integration and runtime validation
- **Modern Design**: Built with Python's latest features and best practices
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Extensible through plugins for custom behaviors
- **Signal-Based Event System**: Hook into the client's lifecycle with a flexible event system
- **Async Support**: Efficient asynchronous operations where appropriate
- **Resource-Oriented**: Intuitive, object-oriented API that matches Paperless-NgX's resource model
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite ensuring reliability

## Design Philosophy

Paperap follows these core principles:

1. **Developer Experience First**: Clear, intuitive interfaces with excellent documentation
2. **Type Safety**: Leverage Python's type system for better code quality
3. **Extensibility**: Build for customization and extension
4. **Performance**: Efficient handling of API requests and responses
5. **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with separation of concerns

## Project Status

Paperap is under active development and not quite ready for production use. As Paperless-NgX evolves, Paperap is maintained to ensure compatibility with the latest versions.

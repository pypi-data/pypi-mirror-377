Provide context management for model status transitions.

The module implements a context manager that safely handles model status changes
during operations like saving or updating. It ensures proper status transitions
and resource locking to maintain data integrity throughout the lifecycle of
model operations.

Examples:
    Basic usage to temporarily change a model's status:

    >>> with StatusContext(model, ModelStatus.UPDATING):
    ...     # Perform operations that require the model to be in UPDATING status
    ...     model.update_field("value")

    Using StatusContext in a model method:

    >>> def save(self):
    ...     with StatusContext(self, ModelStatus.SAVING):
    ...         # Perform save operation
    ...         self._save_to_api()

class StatusContext:

    Manage model status changes safely with proper resource locking.

    Provides a mechanism to temporarily change the status of a model
    while ensuring the previous status is restored upon completion.
    Handles acquisition and release of save locks to prevent concurrent
    modifications that could lead to data inconsistency.

    When used as a context manager, StatusContext will:
    1. Optionally acquire a save lock if the new status is SAVING
    2. Store the model's current status
    3. Set the model's status to the new status
    4. Execute the context body
    5. Restore the original status when exiting
    6. Release any acquired locks

    Attributes:
        model (BaseModel): The model whose status is being managed.
        new_status (ModelStatus): The status to set within the context.
        previous_status (ModelStatus | None): The status before entering the context.

    Examples:
        Using StatusContext in a model method:

        >>> class SomeModel(BaseModel):
        ...     def perform_update(self):
        ...         with StatusContext(self, ModelStatus.UPDATING):
        ...             # Perform an update operation
        ...             self._update_remote_data()

        Using StatusContext with error handling:

        >>> try:
        ...     with StatusContext(model, ModelStatus.SAVING):
        ...         # Attempt to save the model
        ...         model._save_to_api()
        ... except APIError:
        ...     # The model's status will be restored even if an error occurs

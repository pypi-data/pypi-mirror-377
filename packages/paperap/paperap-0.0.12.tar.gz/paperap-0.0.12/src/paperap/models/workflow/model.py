"""
Models for Paperless-NgX workflow functionality.

This module contains the data models representing workflows, workflow triggers,
workflow actions, and workflow runs in the Paperless-NgX system. These models
map directly to the corresponding API resources and provide a Pythonic interface
for interacting with the workflow system.

Workflows in Paperless-NgX consist of triggers (conditions that start a workflow)
and actions (operations performed when a trigger is activated).

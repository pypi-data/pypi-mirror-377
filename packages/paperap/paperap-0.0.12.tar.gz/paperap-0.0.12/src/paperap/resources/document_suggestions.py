"""
Document suggestions resource for the Paperless-NgX API.

This module provides the DocumentSuggestionsResource class, which is responsible for
interacting with the document suggestions endpoint of the Paperless-NgX API. Document
suggestions are recommendations for metadata (such as correspondents, document types,
and tags) that Paperless-NgX generates based on document content analysis.

The resource extends StandardResource to provide specific functionality for retrieving
document suggestions by document ID.

Example:
    >>> suggestions = client.document_suggestions.get_suggestions(document_id=123)
    >>> print(f"Suggested correspondent: {suggestions.correspondent_id}")
    >>> print(f"Suggested tags: {suggestions.tags}")

    Resource class for managing document suggestions in Paperless-NgX.

    This class provides methods to interact with the document suggestions endpoint
    of the Paperless-NgX API. Document suggestions are AI-generated recommendations
    for metadata fields like correspondent, document type, and tags based on the
    document's content.

    The resource primarily offers the get_suggestions method to retrieve suggestions
    for a specific document by its ID.

    Attributes:
        queryset_class (type): The queryset class for document suggestions.
        name (str): The name of the resource used in API paths.
        endpoints (dict): A dictionary mapping endpoint names to their URLs.

    Note:
        This resource overrides the standard detail endpoint to point to the
        suggestions endpoint in the Paperless-NgX API.

    Example:
        >>> suggestions = client.document_suggestions.get_suggestions(document_id=123)
        >>> if suggestions.correspondent_id:
        ...     correspondent = client.correspondents.get(suggestions.correspondent_id)

        Retrieve document suggestions for a specific document ID.

        This method sends a GET request to the document suggestions endpoint to
        retrieve AI-generated metadata suggestions for the specified document.
        These suggestions typically include correspondent, document type, storage path,
        and tags that Paperless-NgX thinks are appropriate for the document based on
        its content analysis.

            document_id: The ID of the document for which to retrieve suggestions.

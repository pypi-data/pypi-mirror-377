# PBA

PBA is a probability bound analysis library for Python that allows one to create and calculate with probability distributions, intervals, and probability boxes (p-boxes) within Python.

Probability distributions can be specified using `pba.distname(**args)` where *distname* is any of the named distributions that `scipy.stats` supports. For instance, `pba.N(0,1)` specifies a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. P-boxes can be created by using interval arguments for these distributions. Intervals can be created using `pba.I(left, right)` where *left* and *right* are expressions for the lower and upper limits of the interval.

## Features

- Interval arithmetic ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic))
- P-box arithmetic ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_bounds_analysis))

## Installation

Install PBA by running:

```bash
    pip install pba
```

    The parameters to encrypt PDF documents

     
    PDF document can be encrypted to protect content from unauthorized access.
    The encryption process applies encryption to all streams (e.g. images) and strings, but not to other items in the PDF document.
    This means the structure of the PDF document is accessible, but the content of its pages is encrypted.
     
    The standard security handler allows access permissions and up to two passwords to be specified for a document:
    A user password (see :attr:`pdftools_sdk.pdf.encryption.Encryption.user_password` ) and an owner password (see :attr:`pdftools_sdk.pdf.encryption.Encryption.owner_password` ).
     
    The following list shows the four possible combinations of passwords and how an application processing such a PDF document behaves:
     
     
    - *No user password, no owner password (no encryption):*
      Everyone can read, i.e. no password required to open the document.
      Everyone can change security settings.
    - *No user password, owner password:*
      Everyone can read, i.e. no password required to open the document.
      Access permissions are restricted (unless the owner password is provided).
      Owner password required to change security settings.
    - *User password, no owner password:*
      User password required to read.
      All access permissions are granted.
    - *User password, owner password:*
      User or owner password required to read.
      Access permissions are restricted (unless the owner password is provided).
      Owner password required to change security settings.
     
     
    Since encryption is not allowed by the PDF/A ISO standards, PDF/A documents must not be encrypted.

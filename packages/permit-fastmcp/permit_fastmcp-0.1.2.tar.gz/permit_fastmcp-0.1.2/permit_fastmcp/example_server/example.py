"""
Example FastMCP server with Permit.io authorization and JWT-based authentication.

NOTE: The `login` tool in this example is NOT the standard way to obtain a JWT in
production. It is included only for simplicity and to make demoing/experimenting
with the example server easy. In real-world scenarios, JWTs should be issued by
your authentication provider (e.g., Auth0, Okta, your own IdP).

- Provides a login tool to get a JWT token.
- Demonstrates how to use the JWT in the Authorization header for secure tool calls.
- Shows how to configure the middleware for JWT identity extraction.

Run this server and use the login tool to get a token, then call greet-jwt with
the token in the Authorization header.

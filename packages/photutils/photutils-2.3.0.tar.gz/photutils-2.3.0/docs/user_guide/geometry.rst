Geometry Functions (`photutils.geometry`)
=========================================

Introduction
------------

The `photutils.geometry` package contains low-level geometry functions
used by aperture photometry to calculate the overlap of aperture shapes
with a pixel grid. These functions are not intended to be used directly
by users, but are used by the higher-level `photutils.aperture` tools.

PingSubnet

A Python script that will detect network adapters and ping every potential IPv4 address in the subnet.

If more than one network adapter is present, it will attempt to determine if any are invalid (possessing a loopback or self-assigned address) and present the user with a list of adapters to choose from.

The output is printed to the screen in tab-separated format (TSV) with a header row.  This makes it easy to import into a spreadsheet or database.

Here is a (partially sanitized) example run:

.. code-block:: console

    Starting PingSubnet at 2024-12-31 23:59:59

    Network Interfaces Detected:
      0 - Ethernet - 192.168.42.200
      1 - Ethernet 2 - 192.168.56.1
    Enter the number to the left of your selection (or 'x' to exit): 0

    Detected properties:
      Windows operating system
      interface name: Ethernet
      local hostname: NunYa
      local IP address: 192.168.42.200
      local network mask: 255.255.255.0
      local MAC address: 00:01:02:AA:BB:C8

    Pinging addresses from 192.168.42.0 to 192.168.42.255

    Threading 254 pings, pinging each host 3 times, and using a timeout of 5000 milliseconds...
    Starting all threads...
    Waiting for all threads to finish...

    All online host IP and MAC addresses:
    IP	MAC	Hostname	Ping	ping unit
    192.168.42.1	00:01:02:AA:BB:01		1.6	ms
    192.168.42.2	00:01:02:AA:BB:02		5.5	ms
    192.168.42.3	00:01:02:AA:BB:03	homeassistant	1.6	ms
    192.168.42.4	00:01:02:AA:BB:04	pi.hole	1.1	ms
    (truncated for brevity)
    192.168.42.200	00:01:02:AA:BB:C8	NunYa	12.5	ms

    44 out of 254 hosts responded to a ping within 5.0 seconds.
    Scanning took 12.22 seconds.

    Goodbye from PingSubnet

In that example you will see the first two devices did not return a hostname.  I still haven't figured out why the socket library can sometimes detect the hostname and sometimes cannot.  If anyone knows, tell me, so I can update this code (or update my DHCP server) to better handle hostnames.

**PipeOptz** is a Python library for building, visualizing, and optimizing complex processing pipelines. It allows you to define a series of operations as a graph, manage the flow of data, and then automatically tune the parameters of those operations to achieve a desired outcome.

The library is built around a few key ideas:

- **`Node`**: A `Node` is the basic building block of a pipeline. It wraps a single Python function and its parameters.

- **`Pipeline`**: The `Pipeline` holds the entire workflow. You add nodes to it and define their dependencies, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The pipeline manages the execution order.

- **`Parameter`**: A `Parameter` defines the search space for a value you want to optimize. The library provides different types, like `IntParameter`, `FloatParameter`, and `ChoiceParameter`.

- **`PipelineOptimizer`**: This is the engine that tunes your pipeline. It takes your pipeline, a set of `Parameter`s to vary, and a `loss_function` to minimize, and uses metaheuristic algorithms (like Genetic Algorithms, Bayesian Optimization, etc.) to find the best parameter values.

The package is provided with a `LICENSE` file which contains the license terms.

## Installation

### Installation from PyPi
The easiest way to install PipeOptz is through pip. Open your terminal and run the follwing command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --user pipeoptz
```

### Installation from source
If you're reading this `README` from a source distribution, you can install PipeOptz after downloading it with:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --user .
```

You can also install the latest development version directly from Github:
```bash
pip install --upgrade --user https://github.com/centralelyon/pipeoptz/archive/main.zip
```

For local development install PipeOptz in editable mode:

## Quick Start

Let's create a basic pipeline with a few arithmetic operations to see how it works.

```python
from pipeoptz import Pipeline, Node

# 1. Define the functions your nodes will execute
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# 2. Create a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(name="arithmetic_pipeline")

# 3. Create nodes and add them to the pipeline with dependencies
# Node A: 5 + 3 = 8
pipeline.add_node(Node(id="A", func=add, fixed_params={"x": 5, "y": 3}))

# Node B: Takes the output of A as input -> 8 * 10 = 80
pipeline.add_node(Node(id="B", func=multiply, fixed_params={"b": 10}), predecessors={"a": "A"})

# Node C: Takes the output of B as input -> 80 + 1 = 81
pipeline.add_node(Node(id="C", func=add, fixed_params={"y": 1}), predecessors={"x": "B"})


# 4. Run the pipeline
# The result is a tuple: (last_node_id, history_of_all_node_outputs, execution_times)
last_node, history, _ = pipeline.run()

print(f"Pipeline finished at node: {last_node}")
print(f"Result of final node 'C': {history[last_node]}")
print(f"History of all node outputs: {history}")

# 5. Visualize the pipeline
# This creates a .dot file and a .png image of the graph
pipeline.to_dot("basic.dot", generate_png=True)
```

This script will output:

```
Pipeline finished at node: C
Result of final node 'C': 81
History of all node outputs: {'A': 8, 'B': 80, 'C': 81}
```

And it will generate an image (`basic.png`) of your pipeline's structure, taken from the `basic.ipynb` example:

</div>

## Optimizing a Pipeline

The real power of `PipeOptz` comes from optimization. The simple example above uses fixed parameters, but you can easily make them tunable.

To do this, you would:
1.  Create a `PipelineOptimizer`.
2.  Define which parameters to tune using objects like `IntParameter` or `FloatParameter`.
3.  Provide a `loss_function` that calculates how "good" the pipeline's output is.
4.  Run the `optimizer.optimize()` method.

For a complete, runnable optimization example, please see the Jupyter Notebook at: **`examples/advanced/simple.ipynb`**.

## Examples
Several example pipelines are provided in the `examples/` directory. These include:
-   `basic/`: A simple pipeline with arithmetic operations.
-   `cond/`: A pipeline demonstrating conditional branching.
-   `for/`: A pipeline demonstrating for loops.
-   `while/`: A pipeline demonstrating while loops.
-   `opti/`: A pipeline demonstrating optimization pipeline with tunable parameters.

## Building Docs

This project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate documentation.

To serve the documentation locally, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local server, and you can view the documentation by opening your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Testing
PipeOptz makes use of pytest for its test suite.
```
pip install pytest
pytest
```

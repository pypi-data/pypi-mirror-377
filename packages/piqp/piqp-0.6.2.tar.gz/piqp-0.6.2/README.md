PIQP is a Proximal Interior Point Quadratic Programming solver, which can solve dense and sparse quadratic programs of the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x} \quad & \frac{1}{2} x^\top P x + c^\top x \\
\text {s.t.}\quad & Ax=b, \\
& h_l \leq Gx \leq h_u, \\
& x_l \leq x \leq x_u,
\end{aligned}
$$

Combining an infeasible interior point method with the proximal method of multipliers, the algorithm can handle ill-conditioned convex QP problems without the need for linear independence of the constraints.

## Features

* PIQP is written in header only C++ 14 leveraging the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library for vectorized linear algebra.
* Dense and sparse problem formulations are supported. For small dense problems, vectorized instructions and cache locality can be exploited more efficiently.
* Special backend for multistage optimization problems.
* Allocation free problem updates and re-solves.
* Open source under the BSD 2-Clause License.

## Interfaces

PIQP support a wide range of interfaces including
* C/C++ (with Eigen support)
* Python
* Matlab/Octave
* R

PIQP is an adapted implementation of [work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-020-00240-9) by Spyridon Pougkakiotis and Jacek Gondzio, and is built on the following open-source libraries:
* [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page): It's the work horse under the hood, responsible for producing optimized numerical linear algebra code.
* [Blasfeo](https://github.com/giaf/blasfeo): Used in the sparse_multistage KKT solver backend.
* [ProxSuite](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite): The code structure (folder/namespace structure, etc.), some utility functions/helper macros, and the instruction set optimized python bindings are based on ProxSuite.
* [SuiteSparse - LDL](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) (modified version): Used for solving linear systems in the sparse solver.
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11): Used for generating the python bindings.
* [cpu_features](https://github.com/google/cpu_features): Used for run-time instruction set detection in the interface bindings.
* [OSQP](https://github.com/osqp/osqp): The C and Matlab interface is inspired by OSQP.
* [Clarabel](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/Clarabel.rs): Parts of the iterative refinement scheme are inspired by Clarabel's implementation.

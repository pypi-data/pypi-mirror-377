Usage example for the procedure PowerBin.

Columns 1–4 of the text file sample_data_ngc2273 contain, respectively:

    x, y coordinates of each spaxel, followed by their Signal and Noise.

In this example, the bin capacity function is defined as ``(S/N)^2``. This is a
convenient choice for illustration because, in the Poissonian limit,
``(S/N)^2`` equals the total signal, which is an additive quantity. This setup
lets us compare the behaviour of binning with an additive capacity versus a
non‑additive one. PowerBin does not require the capacity to be additive — you
can verify this in the example by setting ``covariance = True``.

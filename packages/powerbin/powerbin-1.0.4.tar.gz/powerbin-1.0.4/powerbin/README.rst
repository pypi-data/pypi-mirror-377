This `PowerBin` package provides a Python implementation of the **PowerBin** algorithm — a modern alternative to the classic Voronoi binning method. Like Voronoi binning, it performs 2D adaptive spatial binning to achieve a nearly constant value per bin of a chosen *capacity* (e.g., signal‑to‑noise ratio or any other user‑defined function of the bin spaxels).

**Key advances over the classic method include:**

-   **Centroidal Power Diagram:** Produces bins that are nearly round, convex, and connected, and eliminates the disconnected or nested bins that could occur with earlier approaches.

-   **Scalability:** The entire algorithm scales with **O(N log N)** complexity, removing the **O(N^2)** bottleneck previously present in both the bin-accretion and regularization steps. This makes processing million‑pixel datasets practical.

-   **Stable CPD construction:** Generates the tessellation via a heuristic inspired by packed soap bubbles, avoiding the numerical fragility of formal CPD solvers with realistic non-additive capacities (e.g., correlated noise).

The algorithm combines a fast initial bin-accretion phase with iterative regularization, and is described in detail in `Cappellari (2025) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06903>`_.

Minimal example
---------------

Below is a minimal usage example you can copy into a script (or run the
provided example in ``powerbin/examples/example.py``).

In this example, the bin capacity function is defined as ``(S/N)^2``. This is a
convenient choice for illustration because, in the Poissonian limit,
``(S/N)^2`` equals the total signal, which is an additive quantity. This setup
lets us compare the behaviour of binning with an additive capacity versus a
non‑additive one. PowerBin does not require the capacity to be additive — you
can verify this in the example by setting ``covariance = True``.

.. code-block:: python

    from pathlib import Path
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from powerbin import PowerBin

    file_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
    x, y, signal, noise = np.loadtxt(file_dir / 'sample_data_ngc2273.txt').T
    xy = np.column_stack([x, y])

    target_sn = 50

    # Set covariance = True to simulate correlated noise
    covariance = False

    def fun_capacity(index):
        """Return (S/N)^2, which is additive in the Poissonian case."""
        index = np.atleast_1d(index)
        sn = np.sum(signal[index]) / np.sqrt(np.sum(noise[index]**2))
        if covariance:
            sn /= 1 + 1.07 * np.log10(len(index))
        return sn**2

    # Here target capacity = target_sn^2, consistent with our choice of capacity definition
    pow = PowerBin(xy, fun_capacity, target_sn**2, verbose=1)

    # PowerBin reports the fractional RMS of the bin capacity (here, (S/N)^2).
    # To obtain the fractional scatter in S/N itself, take the square root of the capacity values.
    # (By error propagation, dividing the capacity scatter by 2 gives the same result.)
    sn_bin = np.sqrt(pow.capacity[~pow.single])
    rms_frac = np.std(sn_bin, ddof=1) / np.mean(sn_bin) * 100
    print(f'Fractional S/N Scatter: {rms_frac:.1f} %')

    # The binning was performed on (S/N)^2, but for plotting we want S/N.
    # Apply a square-root scaling to the capacity before plotting.
    pow.plot(capacity_scale='sqrt', ylabel='S/N')
    plt.pause(5)

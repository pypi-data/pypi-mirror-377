# Installation

```bash
pip install prefect coiled
```

If you haven't used Prefect Cloud before, you'll need to create an account and log in:

```bash
prefect cloud login
```

If you haven't used Coiled before, you'll need to create a Coiled account and log in:

```bash
coiled login
```
and then connect Coiled to your cloud account (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) where Coiled will run your flows.
You can either use our interactive setup CLI:

```bash
coiled setup
```

or via the web app UI at https://cloud.coiled.io/settings/setup

# Create the Prefect push work pool and deployment

To create the push work pool:
```bash
prefect work-pool create --type coiled:push --provision-infra 'example-coiled-pool'
```

and then with `example/` as your working directory, you can create the example deployment:

```bash
prefect deploy --prefect-file prefect.yaml
```

If you make any changes to the deployment (for example, if you want to run your flow on a VM with more memory or a GPU),
then you'll rerun the deploy command after editing the YAML file. Otherwise, there's no need to run these commands more than once.

# Run the flow on Coiled

Because you're using a push work pool, there's no need for you to start the worker.

To run the deployment, you can either run this in another terminal window:

```bash
prefect deployment run 'my-flow/example-coiled-deploy'
```

or use the Prefect UI to initiate a run of the deployment.

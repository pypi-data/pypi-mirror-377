[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the
language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks.

*prek* is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust.
It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it,
while also providing some additional long-requested features.

> [!WARNING]
> prek is not production-ready yet. Some subcommands and languages are not implemented. See the current gaps for drop-in parity: [TODO](https://prek.j178.dev/todo/).
>
> It's already being adopted by [some projects](#who-is-using-prek), please give it a try - we'd love your feedback!

## Features

- üöÄ A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- ‚ö° About [10x faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and uses only half the disk space.
- üîÑ Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- üèóÔ∏è Built-in support for monorepos (i.e. [workspace mode](https://prek.j178.dev/workspace/)).
- üêç Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- üõ†Ô∏è Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- üì¶ [Built-in](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/) Rust-native implementation of some common hooks.

## How to migrate

prek is designed as a drop-in replacement:

- [Install prek](#installation)
- Replace `pre-commit` with `prek` in your commands
- Your existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` works unchanged

```console
$ prek run
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
typos....................................................................Passed
cargo fmt................................................................Passed
cargo clippy.............................................................Passed
```

For configuring `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and writing hooks, you can refer to the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) as prek is fully compatible with it.

## Why prek?

### prek is way faster

- It is about [10x faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and uses only half the disk space.
- It redesigned how hook environments and toolchains are managed, they are all shared between hooks, which reduces the disk space usage and speeds up the installation process.
- Repositories are cloned in parallel, and hooks are installed in parallel if their dependencies are disjoint.
- It uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for creating Python virtualenvs and installing dependencies, which is known for its speed and efficiency.
- It implements some common hooks in Rust, [built in prek](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/), which are faster than their Python counterparts.

### prek provides a better user experience

- No need to install Python or any other runtime, just download a single binary.
- No hassle with your Python version or virtual environments, prek automatically installs the required Python version and creates a virtual environment for you.
- Built-in support for workspaces (or monorepos), each subproject can have its own `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
- `prek run` has some nifty improvements over `pre-commit run`, such as:
    - `prek run --directory <dir>` runs hooks for files in the specified directory, no need to use `git ls-files -- <dir> | xargs pre-commit run --files` anymore.
    - `prek run --last-commit` runs hooks for files changed in the last commit.
    - `prek run [HOOK] [HOOK]` selects and runs multiple hooks.
- `prek list` command lists all available hooks, their ids, and descriptions, providing a better overview of the configured hooks.
- prek provides shell completions for `prek run <hook_id>` command, making it easier to run specific hooks without remembering their ids.

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the original [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, and it wouldn't be possible without the hard work
of the maintainers and contributors of that project.

And a special thanks to the [Astral](https://github.com/astral-sh) team for their remarkable projects, particularly [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
from which I've learned a lot on how to write efficient and idiomatic Rust code.

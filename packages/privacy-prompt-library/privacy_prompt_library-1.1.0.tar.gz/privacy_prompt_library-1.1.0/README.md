# Privacy-Preserving Prompt Library

A comprehensive Python library that transforms user prompts to protect disability privacy while maintaining functional context for AI interactions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This library helps users interact with AI models without disclosing specific medical conditions by:
- **Detecting** disability mentions in prompts
- **Redacting** medical/diagnostic terms
- **Adding** functional context for better AI responses
- **Preserving** user privacy and intent

## 🔄 How It Works

```
Input: "I'm paralyzed and need help finding accessible restaurants"
↓
Output: "I use mobility equipment and need help finding accessible restaurants. I need step-free access to buildings and accessible parking close to entrances."
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **14 Disability Categories** with comprehensive subgroups
- **Pattern Detection Engine** for identifying disability mentions
- **Redaction Engine** for replacing medical terms
- **Context Enrichment** for adding functional needs
- **Privacy Validation** to ensure no medical data leaks

## � Installation

```bash
pip install privacy-prompt-library
```

## �🚀 Quick Start

### Python API
```python
from prompt_library import transform_prompt

# Transform a single prompt
result = transform_prompt("I'm blind and need coding help")
print(result['output'])
# "I use screen readers and need coding help. Please ensure any visual content includes text descriptions and is compatible with screen readers."

# Get library information
from prompt_library import get_library_info
info = get_library_info()
print(f"Library version: {info['version']}")
```

### 🔑 Key-Based Descriptions (New in v1.1.0)
Transform predefined disability category keys into 60-word functional descriptions:

```python
from prompt_library import transform_by_key, get_supported_keys

# Get all supported keys
keys = get_supported_keys()
print(keys)
# ['visual-impairment', 'hearing-impairment', 'physical-disability', ...]

# Transform a key into a functional description
result = transform_by_key("visual-impairment")
print(result['output'])
# "I have specific visual accessibility needs requiring comprehensive screen reader compatibility..."

# Supported keys:
# - visual-impairment
# - hearing-impairment  
# - physical-disability
# - speech-language-communication-and-swallowing-disability
# - speech-intellectual-autism-spectrum-disorders
# - maxillofacial-disabilities
# - progressive-chronic-disorders
```

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Transform a prompt via CLI
privacy-prompt "I have ADHD and need focus strategies"

# Get library information
privacy-prompt --info

# Custom privacy level
privacy-prompt --privacy-level medium "Your prompt here"
```

### Async Support
```python
from prompt_library import PromptLibrary

library = PromptLibrary()
await library.initialize()
result = await library.transform_prompt("I'm autistic and need help with social situations")
print(result['output'])
```

## 📋 Categories Supported

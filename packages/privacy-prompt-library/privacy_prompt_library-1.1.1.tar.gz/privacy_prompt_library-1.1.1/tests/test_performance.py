        I am writing to request accommodations for my multiple disabilities.
        I have cerebral palsy and use a wheelchair for mobility. I am also
        legally blind and rely on screen reading technology like JAWS and NVDA.
        Additionally, I have hearing loss and use hearing aids, though I still
        struggle in noisy environments and prefer written communication.
        
        My contact information is as follows:
        - Email: john.accessibility@example.com
        - Phone: 555-123-4567

        - SSN: 123-45-6789

        1. All materials provided in accessible formats (large print, electronic)
        2. Sign language interpreters for meetings
        3. Wheelchair accessible meeting rooms
        4. Additional time for tasks requiring reading
        5. Written follow-up for all verbal instructions
        
        I have attached my medical documentation and would appreciate
        a response within 10 business days. Please let me know if you
        need any additional information to process this request.

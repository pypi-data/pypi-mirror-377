class SharpnessMetric(StatefulMetric):
    """
    Laplacian‑variance image‑sharpness metric.

    The sharpness metric is calculated as the variance of the Laplacian of the image.
    The Laplacian is a second-order derivative operator that measures the rate of change of the gradient of the image.
    The variance of the Laplacian is a measure of the amount of edges in the image.
    The higher the variance, the sharper the image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args : Any
        Additional arguments.
    kernel_size : int
        The size of the kernel used by the Laplacian operator.
        Larger values make the sharpness metric less sensitive to fine details and noise,
        while smaller values increase sensitivity to small edges.
        Default is 3.
    call_type : str
        The type of call to use for the metric. IQA metrics, like sharpness, are only supported for single mode.
    **kwargs : Any
        Additional keyword arguments.

        Accumulate the sharpness scores for each batch.

        This metric computes sharpness for each image in the batch using the variance of the Laplacian.
        Higher Laplacian variance indicates higher sharpness (more edge information).
        If the input is a color image (3 channels), the Laplacian variance is computed for each channel
        and the mean is taken. If the input is grayscale (1 channel), the Laplacian variance is computed directly.

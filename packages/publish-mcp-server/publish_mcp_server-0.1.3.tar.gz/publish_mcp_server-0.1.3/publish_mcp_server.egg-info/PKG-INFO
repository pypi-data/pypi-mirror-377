# Publish MCP Server to the MCP Registry

A Python package to help you publish an MCP server to the MCP Registry!

This is an MCP server that contains a prompt the user can use to be able to have their client decide the best way to publish their MCP server. The prompt directs the client to read and decide on the best action to take based on the instructions in the [MCP documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/refs/heads/main/docs/guides/publishing/publish-server.md). Once published anyone can access and use your MCP server from the registry!

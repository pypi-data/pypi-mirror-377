Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

We recommend installing `py-cordex` with conda:

.. code-block:: console

    conda install -c conda-forge py-cordex

This is the preferred method to install Cordex Python Package, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

However, you can also install by using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install py-cordex

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

Or download the `tarball`_:

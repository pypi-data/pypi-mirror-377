# pyNameEntityRecognition

**pyNameEntityRecognition** is a state-of-the-art Python package for LLM-based Named Entity Recognition (NER). It leverages LangChain for LLM orchestration and LangGraph for creating robust, agentic, and self-refining extraction workflows. The package is designed to be highly flexible, provider-agnostic, and easily extensible.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Path Extraction Engine**: Choose between a high-throughput, streamlined LCEL pipeline for efficiency (`mode='lcel'`) or a stateful, self-correcting agentic workflow using LangGraph for maximum accuracy (`mode='agentic'`).
- **Dynamic Schema Definition**: Define your entity extraction targets on the fly using simple Pydantic models. The engine automatically adapts its prompts and parsing to your schema.
- **LLM Agnostic**: Seamlessly switch between different LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, and local models via Ollama. The engine accepts any pre-instantiated LangChain `BaseLanguageModel` object.
- **Automatic Chunking & Merging**: For documents that exceed the LLM's context window, the engine automatically handles NLP-aware text chunking and intelligently merges the results from overlapping chunks.
- **Anti-Hallucination**: The agentic workflow includes a critical validation step that ensures every extracted entity span is an exact, verbatim match of the source text, significantly reducing hallucinations.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Comes with built-in observability features, including structured logging, seamless LangSmith integration, and a `displaCy`-like visualizer for NER outputs.

## Installation

**Note on spaCy Model Dependency**

This package requires the `en_core_web_sm` spaCy model for tokenization. Before using the package, please ensure you have downloaded this model by running:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and packaging.

**Windows Users**: Some dependencies, like `numpy`, may require C++ compiler tools to be installed on your system. If you encounter installation errors related to a missing C++ compiler, please install the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GowthamRao/py_name_entity_recognition.git
    cd py_name_entity_recognition
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using Poetry:**
    If you do not have Poetry installed, please follow the [official installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

    Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary dependencies, including development dependencies.

3.  **Download spaCy Model:**
    The package uses spaCy for robust tokenization. You'll need to download the default English model. You can do this using Poetry's `run` command:
    ```bash
    poetry run python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

    **Note:** If you use a python version manager like `pyenv` and switch to a new python version, you will need to run this command again to download the model for the new environment.

## Configuration

### LLM API Keys

The package uses `python-dotenv` to automatically load environment variables from a `.env` file in your project's root directory. Create a `.env` file to store your API keys:

```
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="..."
```

### LangSmith Observability (Recommended)

To enable detailed tracing and debugging with [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith), add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```
# .env file
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="ls__..."
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="Your-Project-Name" # Optional: The project to log runs to
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use the main `extract_entities` function.

```python
import asyncio
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

# Import the main extraction function
from py_name_entity_recognition import extract_entities
# Import the visualization utility
from py_name_entity_recognition.observability.visualization import display_biores

# 1. Define your extraction schema using Pydantic
class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    """Schema for extracting user information."""
    Person: List[str] = Field(description="The full name of a person.")
    Location: List[str] = Field(description="A city, state, or country.")
    Company: List[str] = Field(description="The name of a company or organization.")

# 2. Define the text you want to process
text = "John Doe, a software engineer at Google, lives in New York. He is meeting with Jane Smith from Microsoft tomorrow."

# 3. Run the extraction
async def main():
    # Use the default 'lcel' mode for fast extraction
    print("--- Running in LCEL Mode ---")
    conll_output = await extract_entities(
        input_data=text,
        schema=UserInfo
    )
    print(conll_output)

    # Display the result as color-coded HTML (works best in Jupyter)
    display_biores(conll_output)

    # Get the output in a structured JSON format
    print("\n--- Running with JSON Output ---")
    json_output = await extract_entities(
        input_data=text,
        schema=UserInfo,
        output_format="json"
    )
    print(json_output)

    # Use the 'agentic' mode for higher accuracy and self-correction
    print("\n--- Running in Agentic Mode ---")
    agentic_output = await extract_entities(
        input_data=text,
        schema=UserInfo,
        mode="agentic"
    )
    display_biores(agentic_output)

# Run the async main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates the core functionality of the package, including schema definition, running different extraction modes, and formatting the output.

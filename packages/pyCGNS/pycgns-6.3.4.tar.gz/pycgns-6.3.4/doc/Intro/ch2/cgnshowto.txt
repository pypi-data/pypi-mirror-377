**CGNS How to?**
++++++++++++++++

The CGNS standard has been specified to cover a large part of the CFD data
usage, a newcomer can be lost with all the possibilities CGNS offers.
We have gathered here some practices of the Onera users of CGNS.
Like a programming language, it is often useful to start by cloning
existing simple examples, or finding out a pattern and copy it into
another piece of code. The purpose of this site is to provide CGNS users
with materials taken from our CGNS experience.
You obviously have to change the examples to fit with your own applications 
parameters and requirements.

Of course, all code examples are in CGNS/Python...

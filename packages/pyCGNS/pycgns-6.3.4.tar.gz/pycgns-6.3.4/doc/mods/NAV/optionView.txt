Option View
+++++++++++

The *Option view* is the place where you set your own parameters 
for *CGNS.NAV*. You should be sure the right options are set because some
of these are very important and could change the actual contents of a 
file you want to store.

You can change values in the *Option view* or edit the ``.cgnsnavoptions.py``
file you can find in your home directory. For example you can customize the
key bindings only in the ``.cgnsnavoptions.py`` file. This file is a plain 
Python file, it is imported and re-generated each time you run 
``CGNS.NAV``.

The ``.CGNS.NAV/historyfile.py`` contains the history of directories where you
opened a *CGNS* file.

Options
~~~~~~~

The check-box options are active when the box is *checked*.
Some are only related to the display of the data, some other are driving
the way *CGNS.NAV* reads or writes the data on disk and have a strong
impact on the  actual CGNS file you will obtain.

  * `Recursive tree display` forces the *Tree view* to open all the children
     recursively. We strongly suggest you *un-check* this box on large files.

  * `One view per tree/node` (Not available) when active you cannot open
    more than one view per tree/node.

  * `Show columns titles` is used to show/hide the top titles of tables

  * `Show menu help balloons` activates ugly yelllow balloons giving a hint
    on the purpose of the icons in the views menus.

  * `Recurse SIDS patterns load/copy` indicates that you want to load or
    copy the SIDS CGNS sub-trees in a recursive way. For example, if you
    load the `CGNSBase_t` pattern you will obtain the whole SIDS pattern,
    all pattern children of `CGNSBase_t` will be loaded as well.

  * `Load node on display required` (Not available) to save memory and time,
    CGNS node is read from the file only when *CGNS.NAV* needs to display it.

  * `Check on the fly` (Not available) forces a check each time you modify 
    a tree.

  * `Follow links during file load` indicates that the links *CGNS.NAV*
    encounters into a CGNS file have to be followed or not.

  * `Do NOT follow links during file save` means that the links will be
    ignored during save which has the effect to *merge* all the tree nodes
    into the same root file.

  * `Do not load large DataArrays`

  * `Show 1D values as plain Python types`

  * `Show SIDS status column`
 
  * `Max tree parse recursion level`

  * `Max length of data displayed in table`

  * `History file name`

  * `Default profile`

  * `Profile path list`

  * `Force fortran flag in numpy arrays`

  * `Transpose array for edit/view`

.. _keymousebindings:

Default key/mouse bindings per view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *<C-x>* notation stands for *<Control-X>*, that is pressing the *Control*
key and the *X* letter key at the same time. The mouse actions can be a
*Single* or a *Double* click on the Left, Middle or Right button.

QuickStart
++++++++++

The first window you see when you start ``CGNS.NAV`` is the *Control View*.
This main view helps you to find out the views you have and on which 
CGNS tree they refer to.

If you select the line of an existing view in the
*Control view* and press `Return`, this view will be raised on your screen.
You can find back the *Control view* from any other view
just pressing the `BackSpace` key 
(See :ref:`Key/Mouse Bindings <keymousebindings>`).

From its icon menu you can *create* a new CGNS/Python tree, you can *Load*
an existing file or open the *Pattern View*. There is also an icon for
the *Option View* and an info about ``CGNS.NAV`` version.

Each time you open a view on a file, the *Control* keeps track of it, you
can check all the views you may have on the same file.

The columns of the lines you see in this *Control* view are:

 * `S` status flag, says if you tree has been modified and needs a save
 * `T` type of view, in this case you only have *tree* views
 * The number of the view if youhave many views for the same CGNS tree
 * The file name (when you create from scratch we propose a default name)
 * The directory where you loaded/saved the file
 * The root node of the view

The *Tree View* appears when you *create* a new tree or when you *open*
an existing one. The tree below is a large one and we have a lot of
information.

You click on the *+/-* icon before any node name in the tree to open/close 
the child sub-tree for this node. A mouse left button simpple click on a node
selects the node. A mouse right button simple click opens the menu for the
selected node. The menu gives you access to some function such as Copy/Paste, 
change node name, type, add a child... Most of these functions have keyboard
shortcuts.

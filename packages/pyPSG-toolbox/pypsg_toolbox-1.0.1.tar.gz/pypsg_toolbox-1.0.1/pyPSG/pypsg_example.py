    Demonstrates the usage of the pyPSG toolbox to read an EDF file, visualize raw signals,
    compute heart rate variability (HRV) and breath rate variability (BRV),
    and extract biomarkers for PPG, ECG, and SpOâ‚‚ signals.

    :param matlab_path: Path to the MATLAB executable (required for ECG fiducial point detection and HRV computation).

    :param channels: Dictionary mapping signal types to EDF channel names.
                     Keys can include "ppg", "ecg", and "spo2".
                     Values are the corresponding channel names in the EDF file.

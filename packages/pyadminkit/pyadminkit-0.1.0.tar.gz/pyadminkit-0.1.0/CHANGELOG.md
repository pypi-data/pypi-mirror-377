## Release Notes

### v0.1.0 - "Foundation Release"

This is the first major release of PyAdminKit, focusing on providing a solid, production-ready database abstraction layer for Python applications. The release includes:

**🎯 Core Features:**
- Complete database abstraction layer with multi-database support
- Type-safe ORM-like model system
- Advanced query builder with chainable API
- Comprehensive migration system
- Async connection pooling and management

**🚀 Getting Started:**
```bash
# Basic installation
pip install pyadminkit

# With MySQL support
pip install pyadminkit[mysql]

# Full installation with all database drivers
pip install pyadminkit[full]
```

**📚 Quick Example:**
```python
from pyadminkit import db, BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

class User(BaseModel):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    
    id: int = None
    username: str
    email: str
    created_at: datetime = None

# Setup and use
await db.set_default_database("mysql://user:pass@localhost/db")
db.register_model(User)
await db.migrate()

user = User(username="alice", email="alice@example.com")
await user.save()
```

**🔧 What's Next:**
- v0.2.0 will focus on web framework integrations (FastAPI, Flask, Django)
- v0.3.0 will add authentication and authorization systems
- v0.4.0 will introduce automatic admin interface generation

**🙏 Acknowledgments:**
Special thanks to the early testers and contributors who helped shape this release.

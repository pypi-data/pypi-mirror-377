A modern deep learning framework built to utilize your hardware.
Pyburn leverages the Burn framework to use a diverse range of backends.
In the current version it exposes the ndarray and wgpu backend. `pyburn` offers fusion capabilites
on both backends and allows for both inference and training.

⚠️ WIP

Pyburn is still in its early phase but its foundations are well defined and mature.
There is more to come.

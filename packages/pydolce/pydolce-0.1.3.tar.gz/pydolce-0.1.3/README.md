# Dolce

*Because broken docs leave a bitter taste.*

**Dolce** is a tool designed to help you maintain high-quality docstrings in your Python code. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure that your docstrings are consistent with your code.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pydolce
```

## Usage

```bash
dolce check # Check docstrings in all python files in the current directory and subdirectories
dolce check src # Check in specific directory
dolce check src/myproject/main.py # Check in specific file
```

### Example

```bash
dolce check tests/samples
```

outputs:

```text
[ ERROR ] tests/samples/wrong_descr.py:1 add
  - DOC401: Docstring states the function does something that the code does not do. (The docstring summary 'Multiply two integers' does not match the code's behavior of adding integers.)
[ ERROR ] tests/samples/behavior.py:4 post_multiplication
  - DOC401: Docstring states the function does something that the code does not do. (The docstring summary says 'Add two integers' but the code performs multiplication.)
  - DOC402: Docstring omits a critical behavior that the code performs. (The code makes an HTTP POST request (critical behavior) but the docstring does not mention this.)
[ ERROR ] tests/samples/typos.py:1 add
  - DOC301: Docstring description contains spelling errors. (Typo in DESCRIPTION: 'intgers' instead of 'integers')
  - DOC302: Docstring parameter description contains spelling errors. (Typo in PARAM_DESCRIPTION: 'Te' instead of 'The')
[ ERROR ] tests/samples/simple.py:1 foo
  - DOC101: Function is missing a docstring.
[ ERROR ] tests/samples/simple.py:5 fibonacci
  - DOC203: Missing parameter in documention (Parameter 'n' in signature but not documented.)
[  OK   ] tests/samples/simple.py:17 subtract

Summary:
‚úì Correct: 1
‚úó Incorrect: 5
```

## Configure

Right now **dolce** can be configured via `pyproject.toml` file. You can specify which rules to check and which to ignore. By default it will check all rules.

```toml
[tool.dolce]
target = [
  # Set of rules to check
  "DOC101",
]
disable = [
  # Set of rules to ignore
  "DOC101",
]
```

### Quick reference of available rules

```bash
dolce rules
```

- **DOC101:** Function is missing a docstring.
- **DOC102:** Class is missing a docstring.
- **DOC103:** Class docstring has invalid syntax.
- **DOC201:** Duplicate parameters in docstring.
- **DOC202:** Documented parameter does not exist
- **DOC203:** Missing parameter in documention
- **DOC204:** Parameter description is missing
- **DOC205:** Return missing from docstring
- **DOC206:** Parameter type missing
- **DOC206:** Invalid parameter type
- **DOC204:** Invalid return type
LLM based rules:
- **DOC301:** Docstring description contains spelling errors.
- **DOC302:** Docstring parameter description contains spelling errors.
- **DOC303:** Docstring return description contains spelling errors.
- **DOC401:** Docstring states the function does something that the code does not do.
- **DOC402:** Docstring omits a critical behavior that the code performs.

### Use of LLM

By default **dolce** will try to run locally `qwen3:8b` model via `ollama` provider. You can visit the [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) site for installation instructions.

`qwen3:8b` has relatively good performance while fitting in an RTX 4060 GPU (8GB VRAM). However, if you want to use a different model or provider you can configure the default options in the `pyproject.toml` of your project like this:

```toml
[tool.dolce]
url = "http://localhost:11434"
model = "codestral"
provider = "ollama"
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_ENVIROMENT_VAR"
```

## To be implemented

- Add cache system to avoid re-checking unchanged code
- Support for ignoring specific code segments, files, directories, etc
- Support parallel requests
... much more!

## üì¶ For Developers

Make sure you have the following tools installed before working with the project:

- [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) ‚Üí Python project and environment management
- [**make**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) ‚Üí run common project tasks via the `Makefile`

### Getting Started

Install dependencies into a local virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync --all-groups
```

This will create a `.venv` folder and install everything declared in `pyproject.toml`.

Then, you can activate the environment manually depending on your shell/OS:

- **Linux / macOS (bash/zsh):**

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell):**

  ```powershell
  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

- **Windows (cmd.exe):**

  ```cmd
  .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```

### Running

```bash
uv run dolce check path/to/your/code
```

### Linting, Formatting, and Type Checking

```bash
make qa
```

Runs **Ruff** for linting and formatting, and **Mypy** for type checking.

### Running Unit Tests

Before running tests, override any required environment variables in the `.env.test` file.

```bash
make test
```

Executes the test suite using **Pytest**.

### Building the Project

```bash
make build
```

Generates a distribution package inside the `dist/` directory.

### Cleaning Up

```bash
make clean
```

Removes build artifacts, caches, and temporary files to keep your project directory clean.

### Building docs

```bash
make docs
```

Generates the project documentation inside the `dist/docs` folder.

When building the project (`make build`) the docs will also be generated automatically and
included in the distribution package.

Contributions are welcome!
Please ensure all QA checks and tests pass before opening a pull request.

    A pipeline for chaining operations on data with parallel execution.
    
    Pipeline allows you to compose multiple operations that will be applied
    sequentially to input data, with automatic parallelization for performance.

        chunk_size (int, optional): Size of chunks for parallel processing. 
                                   Defaults to optimal size based on data.
    
    Example:
        >>> pipeline = Pipeline(chunk_size=100)
        >>> pipeline.add(lambda x: x * 2)      # Double each value
        >>> pipeline.add(lambda x: x + 1)      # Add 1 to each value

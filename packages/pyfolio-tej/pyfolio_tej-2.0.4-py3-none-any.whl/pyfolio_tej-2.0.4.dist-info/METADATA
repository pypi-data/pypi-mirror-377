pyfolio is a Python library for performance and risk analysis of financial portfolios that works well with the [Zipline](https://zipline.ml4trading.io/) open source backtesting library.

## Trading Strategy Analysis with pyfolio

At the core of pyfolio are various tear sheets that combine various individual plots and summary statistics to
provide a comprehensive view of the performance of a trading algorithm.

Here's an example of a simple tear sheet analyzing a strategy executed with the Zipline backtesting engine:

### Performance Metrics

The tear sheet presents performance and risk metrics for the strategy separately during the backtest and out-of-sample periods:

### Performance Plots

In addition, it visualizes how several risk and return metrics behave over time:

## Installation

To install pyfolio, run:

```bash
pip install pyfolio-reloaded
```
or

```bash
conda install -c ml4t pyfolio-reloaded
```

#### Development

For development, you may want to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to avoid dependency conflicts between pyfolio and other Python projects you have.

To get set up with a virtual env, run:
```bash
mkvirtualenv pyfolio
```

Next, clone this git repository and run `python -m pip install .[all]` and edit the library files directly.

## Usage

A good way to get started is to run the pyfolio examples in a
[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). To do this, you first want to
start a Jupyter notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

From the notebook list page, navigate to the pyfolio examples directory
and open a notebook. Execute the code in a notebook cell by clicking on it
and hitting Shift+Enter.

## API Docs

Auto-generated documentation is here: <https://yaleman.github.io/pygoodwe/>

## Installation

You need to have Python 3 and pip installed. Then:

    python -m pip install pygoodwe

Determine the Station ID from the GOODWE site as follows. Open the [Sems Portal](https://www.semsportal.com). The Plant Status will reveal the Station ID in the URL. Example:

    https://www.semsportal.com/powerstation/powerstatussnmin/11112222-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-ddddeeeeeffff

Then the Station ID is `11112222-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-ddddeeeeeffff`.

To use example.py or the other examples, copy config.py.example to config.py and add your details.

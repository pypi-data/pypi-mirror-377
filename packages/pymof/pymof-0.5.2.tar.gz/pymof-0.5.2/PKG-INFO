## Mass-ratio-variance based outlier factor

### Latest news
1. Change the document to remove the boxplot visualization of Mass-ratio distribution.
2. Implementing a new class WMOF() for detecting anomaly in data stream.
3. Documents are editted with more examples.

### Introduction

An outlier in a finite dataset is a data point that stands out from the rest. It is often isolaed, unliked normal data points, which tend to cluster together. To identify outliers, the Mass-ratio-variance based Outlier Factor (MOF) was developed and implemented. MOF works by calculating a score of each data point based on the density of itself with respect to other data points. Outliers always have fewer nearby data points so their mass-ratio (a density ratio if the same volumes are used) will be different from normal points. This MOF algorithm does not require any extra settings.

### Mass-ratio-variance based Outlier Factor (MOF)
The outlier score of each data point is calculated using the Mass-ratio-variance based Outlier Factor (MOF). MOF quantifies the global deviation of a data point's density relative to the rest of the dataset. This global perspective is crucial because an outlier's score depends on its overall isolation from all other data points. By analyzing the variance of the mass ratio, MOF can effectively identify data points with significantly lower density compared to their neighbors, indicating their outlier status.

> Initialize a model object `MOF`

    Parameters :
    Return :
            self : object

> Fit data to  `MOF` model

    Parameters :
            Data  : numpy array of shape (n_points, d_dimensions)

### Windowing mass-ratio-variance based outlier factor (WMOF)
This algorithm is an extension of the mass-ratio-variance outlier factor algorithm (MOF). WMOF operates on overlapping windows of fixed size, specified by the user. The use of overlapping windows ensures that anomalies occurring at window boundaries are not missed. For each window, the MOF score is computed for all data points within the window.
#### WMOF() 
> Initialize a model object `WMOF`

    Parameters :
    Return :
            self : object
                    object of WMOF model
#### WMOF.fit(Data, Window = 1000, Overlap_ratio = 0.2)
> Fit data to  `WMOF` model

    Parameters :
            Data : numpy array of shape (n_samples, n_features)
                The input samples.
            Window : integer (int)
                number of points for each calculation
                default window size is 1000.
            Overlap_ratio : float
                0.0 <= Overlap_ratio <= 0.5
                A Overlap_ratio between window frame.
                default ratio is 0.2
    Return :
            self  : object
                    fitted estimator

#### WMOF.detectAnomaly(theshold)
> Detect data points that have `WMOF` score greater than theshold value

    Parameters :
            theshold : float
                A theshold value for detect anomaly points
    Return :
            idx : numpy array of shape (n_samples,)
                An index array of anomaly ponts in data

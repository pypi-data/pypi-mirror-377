PyroChain combines PyTorch's deep learning capabilities with LangChain's agentic AI to automate feature extraction from complex, multimodal data. AI agents collaborate to understand, process, and extract meaningful features from text, images, and structured data.

## 🎯 What Problem Does PyroChain Solve?

**Traditional Feature Engineering is Hard:**

- Manual feature extraction is time-consuming and error-prone
- Different data types require different approaches
- Domain expertise is needed to create meaningful features
- Features become outdated as data patterns change

**PyroChain Makes It Easy:**

- AI agents automatically extract relevant features from any data type
- Collaborative agents validate and refine features using chain-of-thought reasoning
- Learns from your data to improve feature quality over time
- Works seamlessly with existing ML pipelines

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🤖 AI Agents**: Intelligent agents that collaborate to extract, validate, and refine features
- **📊 Multimodal Processing**: Handle text, images, and structured data in one pipeline
- **⚡ Lightweight & Fast**: Efficient LoRA adapters that train quickly on your data
- **🧠 Memory & Learning**: Agents remember past decisions and improve over time
- **🛒 E-commerce Ready**: Built-in tools for product recommendations and customer analysis
- **🏗️ Production Ready**: Scalable architecture designed for real-world applications

## 💡 Use Cases

**E-commerce & Retail:**

- Product recommendation systems
- Customer sentiment analysis
- Inventory optimization
- Price prediction and analysis

**Content & Media:**

- Text classification and tagging
- Image content analysis
- Content recommendation
- Automated content moderation

**Business Intelligence:**

- Customer behavior analysis
- Market trend detection
- Risk assessment
- Automated reporting

## 🛠️ Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
pip install pyrochain
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irfanalidv/PyroChain.git
cd PyroChain
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- LangChain 0.1+
- Transformers 4.20+

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from pyrochain import PyroChain
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
from textblob import TextBlob
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load real transformer model and tokenizer
model_name = "microsoft/DialoGPT-small"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Initialize PyroChain with transformer model
pyrochain = PyroChain()

# Load REAL data from IMDB dataset
print("📚 Loading real IMDB dataset...")
dataset = load_dataset("imdb", split="train[:4]")  # Load first 4 real reviews

# Extract features from REAL dataset with TextBlob sentiment analysis
for i, sample in enumerate(dataset):
    text = sample["text"]
    label = sample["label"]  # 0 = negative, 1 = positive

    # Use TextBlob for real sentiment analysis
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    sentiment_score = (blob.sentiment.polarity + 1) / 2  # Convert to 0-1 scale

    data = {
        "text": text,
        "title": f"IMDB Review {i+1}",
        "rating": 5 if label == 1 else 1,
        "category": "movie_review"
    }

    features = pyrochain.extract_features(
        data,
        "Extract features for sentiment analysis using TextBlob and transformer model"
    )

    print(f"Text: {text[:100]}...")
    print(f"Real Label: {label} | TextBlob Sentiment: {sentiment_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Features: {len(features['features'])}")
    print("---")
```

### Real Data Example

class CreateSupergroup:
    async def create_supergroup(
        self: "pyrogram.Client",
        title: str,
        description: str = "",
        message_auto_delete_time: int = 0,

        """Create a new supergroup.

        .. note::

            If you want to create a new basic group, use :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.create_group` instead.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users.rst

        Parameters:
            title (``str``):
                The supergroup title.

            description (``str``, *optional*):
                The supergroup description.

            message_auto_delete_time (``int``, *optional*):
                Message auto-delete time value, in seconds; must be from 0 up to 365 * 86400 and be divisible by 86400. If 0, then messages aren't deleted automatically.

            is_forum (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to create a forum supergroup chat. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Chat`: On success, a chat object is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                await app.create_supergroup("Supergroup Title", "Supergroup Description")
        """

                about=description,
                megagroup=True,
                ttl_period=message_auto_delete_time,
                forum=is_forum
            )

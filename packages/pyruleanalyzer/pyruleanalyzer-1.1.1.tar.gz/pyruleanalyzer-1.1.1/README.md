# pyRuleAnalyzer

pyRuleAnalyzer is a Python-based tool designed that supports rule extraction, analysis, and simplification from tree-based AI models. It provides a comprehensive pipeline to generate interpretable models, remove redundancies, and evaluate model accuracy and interpretability.

Key functionalities include:

- Extracting decision rules from Random Forests and Decision Trees.

- Identifying and removing redundant and duplicate rules.

- Evaluating initial and simplified models through classification accuracy, confusion matrices, and interpretability metrics.

- Computing sparsity and interpretability scores to assess model complexity and understandability.

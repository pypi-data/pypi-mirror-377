<p align="center"><b>üìå Pysible ‚Äì Security Library for FastAPI</b></p>

Pysible is an **open-source security library** for [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) applications.  
It provides **plug-and-play** security features like authentication, authorization, API rate limiting, and logging ‚Äî all with minimal boilerplate.  

---

## üöÄ Features
- üîë **JWT Authentication** ‚Äì Simple login/logout with token-based security.  
- üõ° **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** ‚Äì Fine-grained access control for endpoints. *(requires Redis)*  
- ‚ö° **API Rate Limiting** ‚Äì Redis-powered rate limiting to protect your APIs. *(requires Redis)*  
- üìù **Logging System** ‚Äì Store logs at different levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, etc.) for observability.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Plug-and-Play** ‚Äì Import features and attach them to endpoints using FastAPI‚Äôs `Depends`.  

üëâ Install directly from PyPI:  
```bash
pip install pysible
```

---

## üìñ Overview of Pysible
Pysible is built on top of FastAPI‚Äôs `Depends` functionality.  

When you install `pysible` and run:  
```bash
pysible action
```
It will:
1. Connect to your running **Redis instance** (you provide host & port).  
2. Generate a new project folder with your chosen name.  
3. Inside `/your_project_folder/src` ‚Üí You‚Äôll build your FastAPI app (business logic + endpoints).  

---

## üõ† Usage
After installing, from your desired directory run:  
```bash
pysible action
```

You‚Äôll be prompted for setup:
```text
Project Name:->:
Redis is running now? (yes/no):->:
Host of Redis (e.g. 'localhost'):->:
Port of Redis:->:
Redis DB Number (e.g. '0', '1'):->:
Do you want to load dummy data for testing? (yes/no):
Do you want to set your own secret key? (yes/no):
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
Pysible **requires a running Redis instance**.  
It automatically connects using the provided host & port.  

If Redis isn‚Äôt running, you may see:
```
‚ùå redis.exceptions.ConnectionError: Error 111 connecting to localhost:6379. Connection refused.
```

‚úÖ Make sure Redis is installed and running before starting your FastAPI app with Pysible.  

---

## üëâ Optional but recommended

1- Pysible gives you the option to load dummy data into your redis db for testing purpose.<br/>

2- While not required, this step provides a ready-to-use setup so you can start experimenting immediately‚Äîno need to define custom users or roles upfront.<br/>

Dummy Data Format-<br/>
```python
Default User - { "user_id : "root",
                    "password : "unique_password",
                    "roles: : ["root", "admin"]
                    }

Default Roles - "role:root", mapping={"name": "root"}
                "role:admin", mapping={"name": "admin"}
                "role:editor", mapping={"name": "editor"}
                "role:viewer", mapping={"name": "viewer"}
```
3- It is recommended to set a "UNIQUE_SECRET_KEY" otherwise you will get a warning "SECRET_KEY must be set in 'Production' ! Please configure it as an environment variable."

## ‚ú® Step-by-Step Guide
*We‚Äôll start with the most basic features ‚Äî login and logout ‚Äî and then gradually cover advanced functionalities step by step.*
### 1. Login / Logout
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends 
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from pysible.core import Auth

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/login")
async def login_func(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    return Auth.login(form_data=form_data)

@app.get("/logout")
async def logout_func():
    return Auth.logout()
```
In the above code snippet, the `Auth class` is imported from `pysible.core`.<br/>
Inside our `/login endpoint`, we use `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()` because we expect the client to send a username (user_id) and password through a form.

üëâ Test easily using Swagger UI (`/docs`).  
Default credentials (if dummy data loaded):  
- **Username**: `root`  
- **Password**: `unique_password`  

---

### 2. JWT Authentication
*JWT comes from `RBAC` in `pysible`.*
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends 
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from pysible.core import Auth, RBAC

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/login")
def login_func(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    return Auth.login(form_data=form_data)

# Pass RBAC.require_token as a dependecy in your endpoint.
# If user is authenticated then only user is allowed to access this endpoint.

@app.get("/secure_route", user=Depends(RBAC.require_token))
def secure_endpoint():
    return {"This is a secure endpoint."}

@app.get("/logout")
def logout_func():
    return Auth.logout()
```

---

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*You can pass the list of `specific` allowed roles to the endpoints.<br/>
Only users with `atleast one` allowed role/roles can access this endpoint.* 
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends 
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from pysible.core import Auth, RBAC

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/login")
async def login_func(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    return Auth.login(form_data=form_data)

# Pass the list of allowed of roles in the endpoint as an dependency.
# If authenticated user has atleast one role from the list of allowed roles then only user is allowed to access this endpoint.

@app.get("/secure_route", 
         user=Depends(RBAC.require_token), 
         role=Depends(RBAC.require_role(["root", "admin", "manager"])))
async def secure_endpoint():
    return {"This is a secure endpoint."}

@app.get("/logout")
async def logout_func():
    return Auth.logout()
```

---

### 4. Rate Limiting
*Rate Limiting restricts the number of times an endpoint can be called or accessed within a defined time window.*<br/>
*It is a crucial feature in modern web applications as it helps protect your app and resources from excessive requests, unusual traffic spikes, or automated bot attacks.*
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from pysible.core import Auth, RBAC, PyRate

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/login")
async def login_func(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    return Auth.login(form_data=form_data)

# PyRate.rate_limiter(1, 5) means that this endpoint can be accessed 1 time per second, with a burst window capacity of 5.
# The first number (1) represents the allowed requests per second.
# The second number (5) represents the size of the burst window (the temporary extra capacity allowed during short traffic spikes).
# You can change these values as per your needs.

@app.get("/secure_route",
         user=Depends(RBAC.require_token),
         role=Depends(RBAC.require_role(["root", "admin", "manager"])),
         rate=Depends(PyRate.rate_limiter(1, 5)))
async def secure_endpoint():
    return {"This is a secure endpoint."}

@app.get("/logout")
async def logout_func(user_id: str = Depends(RBAC.require_token)):
    return Auth.logout(user_id)
```

Here:  
- `1` = requests allowed per second  
- `5` = burst window (extra capacity allowed during spikes)  

---

### 5. Multiple Dependencies Together
*If you want, you can pass all or multiple dependecies together as shown below:*
```python
@app.get("/secure_route", dependencies=[
    Depends(RBAC.require_role(["root", "admin"])),
    Depends(RBAC.require_token),
    Depends(PyRate.rate_limiter(1, 5))])
async def secure_endpoint():
    return {"This is a secure endpoint."}
```

‚úÖ Access granted only if:  
1. User has a valid JWT.  
2. User has at least one allowed role (`root`/`admin`).  
3. Request rate is within the allowed limit.  

Only when all three conditions are satisfied, access to this endpoint is granted.

---

### 6. Universal Logger
Logs are stored in `/logs/app.log`.  

**Sample Output**:
```text
2025-09-16 01:16:36,025 - INFO - User 'root' logged in successfully.
2025-09-16 01:16:46,407 - WARNING - 'Unauthorized' access attempt | User: 'root' | Endpoint: '/secure_route'
2025-09-16 01:36:41,741 - WARNING - 'Too many requests' to endpoint: '/health'
2025-09-16 00:58:50,585 - INFO - User 'root' logged out successfully.
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
Pysible provides a **ready-to-use security toolkit** for FastAPI:  
- Authentication (JWT)  
- Authorization (RBAC)  
- Rate Limiting  
- Centralized Logging  

With just a few lines of code, you can secure endpoints and scale safely üöÄ

## üóÑ Database Operations
Pysible uses Redis to manage users & roles.  
Example: adding users directly via the Redis client.

# Open Home Foundation Matter Server

![Matter Logo](docs/matter_logo.svg)

The Open Home Foundation Matter Server is an [officially certified](https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/open-home-foundation-matter-server/) Software Component to create a Matter controller. It serves as the foundation to provide Matter support to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) but its universal approach makes it suitable to be used in other projects too.

This project implements a Matter Controller Server over WebSockets using the
[official Matter (formerly CHIP) SDK](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip)
as a base and provides both a server and client implementation.

The Open Home Foundation Matter Server software component is funded by [Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com/) (a member of the CSA) and donated to [The Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/).

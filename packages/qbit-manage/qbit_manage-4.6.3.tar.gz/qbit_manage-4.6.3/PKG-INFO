This is a program used to manage your qBittorrent instance such as:

* Tag torrents based on tracker URLs
* Apply category based on `save_path` to uncategorized torrents in category's `save_path`
* Change categories based on current category (`cat_change`)
* Remove unregistered torrents (delete data & torrent if it is not being cross-seeded, otherwise it will just remove the torrent)
* Recheck paused torrents sorted by lowest size and resume if completed
* Remove orphaned files from your root directory that are not referenced by qBittorrent
* Tag any torrents that have no hard links outside the root folder (for multi-file torrents the largest file is used)
* Apply share limits based on groups filtered by tags/categories and allows optional cleanup to delete these torrents and contents based on maximum ratio and/or time seeded. Additionally allows for a minimum seed time to ensure tracker rules are respected and minimum number of seeders to keep torrents alive.
* RecycleBin function to move files into a RecycleBin folder instead of deleting the data directly when deleting a torrent
* Built-in scheduler to run the script every x minutes. (Can use `--run` command to run without the scheduler)
* Webhook notifications with [Notifiarr](https://notifiarr.com/) and [Apprise API](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api) integration

## Supported Qbittorrent Versions

We rely on [qbittorrent-api](https://pypi.org/project/qbittorrent-api/) to interact with Qbittorrent.

Generally expect new releases of Qbittorrent to not immediately be supported. Support CANNOT be added until qbittorrent-api adds support for the version. Any material changed and impact must then be assessed prior to Qbit Manage supporting it.

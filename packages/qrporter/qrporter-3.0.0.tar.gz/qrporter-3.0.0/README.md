# QRPorter — Local Wi‑Fi QR File Transfer

A lightweight desktop + web utility for moving files between a mobile device and a Desktop PC over the local network. Scan a QR code to send or receive files directly on the LAN—no cloud, no cables, no mobile app and no accounts.

---

## Why QRPorter

- Simple: one‑click “Send to mobile” or “Get from mobile” for quick transfers.
- Private: traffic stays on the local network; nothing is uploaded to third‑party servers.
- Cross‑device: works with modern mobile browsers (iOS/Android) and Windows, Linux & MacOS desktop.

---

## Features

- PC → Mobile: Select the file & generate a QR code; scan to download the selected file on your mobile.
- Mobile → PC: Generate the QR code, visit the upload page from the QR on mobile; send a file back to the PC.
- One‑time session tokens and basic rate limiting for local safety.
- Send/Receive multiple files at once.

## How to Use

- Send file to mobile (PC → Mobile):
1. Click “Send file to mobile.”
2. Pick a file (or multiple); a QR code appears.
3. Scan the QR with the phone camera/browser to download.

- Get file from mobile (Mobile → PC):
1. Click “Get file from mobile.”
2. Scan the QR displayed on the phone.
3. Choose a file (or multiple) on the phone and upload it; the PC saves it locally.

Default folders (auto‑created):

- Incoming: `received/`

Use the “Open Outgoing/Incoming Folder” buttons in the UI to open these locations.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

1. Phone can’t open the link:
- Ensure PC and phone are on the same Wi‑Fi; avoid guest/isolated networks.
- Allow Python in Windows Defender Firewall for Private networks.

2. Very slow uploads:
- Keep the phone screen on and the browser in the foreground (backgrounding throttles).
- Prefer 5 GHz Wi‑Fi and short distance to the access point.
- Save to an SSD when possible.

3. URL shows a tuple like `('192.168.x.x', 52546)`:
- Ensure the app uses only `getsockname()[0]` (IP string) when forming URLs and restart the app.

4. File size limit:
- 1GG per transper.

## Project Rationale

QRPorter focuses on frictionless, local‑only transfers for everyday workflows—moving screenshots, media, or documents between PC and phone—without cloud services, cables, drivers, or mobile app installs on mobile.

"""QuickScale Project Tests

This directory contains starter tests for your QuickScale project.

The comprehensive test suite for QuickScale's template generation and functionality
is maintained in the main QuickScale repository. This ensures that the generated
project components work correctly.

This directory provides:
- test_sample.py: Basic starter tests for your project
- docs/README_API_AUTH.md: Documentation about the API features in your project

Feel free to add your own application-specific tests here.

Django's test runner will automatically discover tests in this directory 
and its subdirectories.

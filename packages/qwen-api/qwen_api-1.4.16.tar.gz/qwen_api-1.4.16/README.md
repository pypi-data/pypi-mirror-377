## üì¶ Installation

To install the package, use:

```bash
pip install qwen-api
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from qwen_api.client import Qwen
from qwen_api.types.chat import ChatMessage

# Create a client instance
client = Qwen()

# Create a chat message
messages = [
   ChatMessage(
      role="user",
      content="what is LLM?",
      web_search=True,
      thinking=False,
   )
]

# Get a response from the API
response = client.chat.create(
   messages=messages,
   model="qwen-max-latest",
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

### File Upload Example

Here's how to upload a file and include it in a chat request:

```python
from qwen_api import Qwen
from qwen_api.core.exceptions import QwenAPIError
from qwen_api.core.types.chat import ChatMessage, TextBlock, ImageBlock


def main():
    client = Qwen(logging_level="DEBUG")

    try:
        # Upload an image file
        getdataImage  = client.chat.upload_file(
            file_path="tes_image.png"
        )

        # Create a chat message with both text and image content
        messages = [ChatMessage(
            role="user",
            web_search=False,
            thinking=False,
            blocks=[
                TextBlock(
                    block_type="text",
                    text="What's in this image?"
                ),
                ImageBlock(
                    block_type="image",
                    url=getdataImage   .file_url,
                    image_mimetype=getdataImage.image_mimetype
                )
            ]
        )]

        # Get a streaming response
        response = client.chat.create(
            messages=messages,
            model="qwen-max-latest",
            stream=True,
        )

        # Process the stream
        for chunk in response:
            delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
            if 'extra' in delta and 'web_search_info' in delta.extra:
                print("\nSearch results:", delta.extra.web_search_info)
                print()

            print(delta.content, end="", flush=True)

    except QwenAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Async Usage

```python
import asyncio
from qwen_api.client import Qwen
from qwen_api.types.chat import ChatMessage

async def main():
    # Create a client instance
    client = Qwen()

    # Create a chat message
    messages = [
        ChatMessage(
            role="user",
            content="what is LLM?",
            web_search=True,
            thinking=False,
        )
    ]

    # Get a response from the API
    response = await client.chat.acreate(
        messages=messages,
        model="qwen-max-latest",
    )

    # Print the response
    print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Asynchronous File Upload Example

Here's how to perform file upload asynchronously:

```python
import asyncio
from qwen_api import Qwen
from qwen_api.core.exceptions import QwenAPIError
from qwen_api.core.types.chat import ChatMessage, TextBlock, ImageBlock


async def main():
    client = Qwen()

    try:
        # Upload an image file asynchronously
        getdataImage  = await client.chat.async_upload_file(
            file_path="tes_image.png"
        )

        # Create a chat message with both text and image content
        messages = [ChatMessage(
            role="user",
            web_search=False,
            thinking=False,
            blocks=[
                TextBlock(
                    block_type="text",
                    text="What's in this image?"
                ),
                ImageBlock(
                    block_type="image",
                    url=getdataImage   .file_url,
                    image_mimetype=getdataImage
                )
            ]
        )]

        # Get a streaming response
        response = await client.chat.acreate(
            messages=messages,
            model="qwen-max-latest",
            stream=True,
        )

        # Process the stream
        async for chunk in response:
            delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
            if 'extra' in delta and 'web_search_info' in delta.extra:
                print("\nSearch results:", delta.extra.web_search_info)
                print()

            print(delta.content, end="", flush=True)

    except QwenAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

To use `qwen-api`, you need to obtain your `AUTH TOKEN` and `COOKIE` from [https://chat.qwen.ai](https://chat.qwen.ai). Follow these steps:

To use Alibaba Cloud OSS functionality, you'll also need to ensure you have the SDK installed:

```bash
poetry add oss2
```

1. **Sign Up or Log In**
   Visit [https://chat.qwen.ai](https://chat.qwen.ai) and sign up or log in to your account.

2. **Open Developer Tools**

   - Right-click anywhere on the page and select `Inspect`, or
   - Use the shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - Navigate to the `Network` tab

3. **Send a Message**
   Go back to [https://chat.qwen.ai](https://chat.qwen.ai) and send a message in the chat.

4. **Find the `completions` Request**
   In the `Network` tab, filter by `Fetch/XHR` and locate a request named `completions`.

5. **Copy the Authorization Token and Cookie**

   - Click the `completions` request and go to the `Headers` tab.
   - Look for the `Authorization` header that starts with `Bearer`, and copy **only the token part** (without the word "Bearer").
     Example:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
     ```
   - Scroll down and find the `Cookie` header. Copy the entire value.
     Example (partial):
     ```
     Cookie: cna=lyp6INOXADYCAbb9MozTsTcp; cnaui=83a0f88d-86d8-...; token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
     ```

6. **Save in `.env` File**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and paste the following:

   ```env
   QWEN_AUTH_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...  # no "Bearer"
   QWEN_COOKIE="cna=lyp6INOXADYCA...; cnaui=83a0f88d-86d8-...; token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
   ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:

- Never share your token or cookie publicly.
- Tokens and cookies may expire. If authentication fails, repeat the steps above to obtain a new one.

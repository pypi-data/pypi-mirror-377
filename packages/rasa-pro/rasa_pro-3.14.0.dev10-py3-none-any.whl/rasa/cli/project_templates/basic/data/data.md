## ðŸ“‚ `data/` â€“ The agent's Business Logic

This folder holds files that define your agentâ€™s skills using "flows". Each flow is a step-by-step conversation pattern (like a recipe) for handling a user goal (e.g., checking a balance, updating an address).

**What youâ€™ll find:**
- Each YAML file = one or more skills.
- Flows are made of steps: collecting info, calling actions, and responding.

**Edit txt files in this folder** to add new skills, change existing flows, or adjust what the agent asks.

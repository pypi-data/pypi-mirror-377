## ðŸ“‚ `data/` â€“ The Agent's Business Logic

This folder holds files that define your telecom agent's skills using "flows". Each flow is a structured sequence of steps that describes the business logic needed to perform a specific goal. 

**What you'll find:**
- **billing/**: Billing and payment flows (bill inquiries, payment processing)
- **network/**: Network service flows (troubleshooting, diagnostics, service checks)
- **general/**: General telecom conversations (greetings, help, support)

**Edit YAML files in this folder** to add new telecom features, modify existing flows, or adjust what the agent asks customers.

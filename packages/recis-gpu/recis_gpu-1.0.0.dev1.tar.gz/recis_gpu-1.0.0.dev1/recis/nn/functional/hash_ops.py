    """Apply Google's FarmHash algorithm to multiple input tensors.

    FarmHash is a family of hash functions developed by Google that provides
    fast, high-quality hashing with good distribution properties. This function
    applies FarmHash to multiple input tensors with configurable split patterns,
    making it suitable for distributed hashing scenarios in recommendation systems.

    Args:
        inputs (List[torch.Tensor]): List of input tensors to be hashed.
            Each tensor should have dtype int8 and contain byte data to be hashed.
            All tensors should be on the same device.
        splits (List[int]): List of split configurations for each input tensor.
            Each integer specifies how the corresponding input tensor should be
            split or processed during hashing. The length should match the
            number of input tensors.

    Returns:
        List[torch.Tensor]: List of hash result tensors, one for each input tensor.
            The exact shape and content depend on the split configuration and
            the underlying FarmHash implementation.

    Example:
        >>> import torch
        >>> from recis.nn.functional.hash_ops import farmhash
        >>> # Create sample int8 input tensors
        >>> input1 = torch.randint(0, 256, (50,), dtype=torch.int8)
        >>> input2 = torch.randint(0, 256, (100,), dtype=torch.int8)
        >>> inputs = [input1, input2]
        >>> # Define split configurations
        >>> splits = [5, 10]  # Split first tensor into 5 parts, second into 10
        >>> # Apply FarmHash
        >>> hash_results = farmhash(inputs, splits)
        >>> print(f"Number of results: {len(hash_results)}")
        >>> # Use in feature hashing pipeline
        >>> user_features = torch.randint(0, 256, (64,), dtype=torch.int8)
        >>> item_features = torch.randint(0, 256, (32,), dtype=torch.int8)
        >>> feature_hashes = farmhash([user_features, item_features], [8, 4])

    Note:
        - Input tensors must have dtype int8 for proper byte-level hashing
        - FarmHash provides better hash quality compared to simpler hash functions
        - Commonly used for feature hashing and consistent hashing in distributed systems
        - The split parameter controls how input data is partitioned for hashing
        - All computations are performed on GPU for optimal performance

    """Singleton factory for managing hash table hook implementations.

    This factory provides centralized management of filter and admission hooks
    for hash tables. It handles registration, creation, and lifecycle management
    of hook implementations, ensuring consistent behavior across the application.

    The factory supports two types of hooks:
        - Filter hooks: Control which features should be removed from the table
        - Admission hooks: Control which features should be admitted to the table

    Attributes:
        _registed_filter (Dict[str, Type[BaseFilterHookImpl]]): Registered filter hook classes.
        _registed_admit (Dict[str, Type[BaseAdmitHookImpl]]): Registered admission hook classes.
        _filters (Dict[str, Dict[Any, BaseFilterHookImpl]]): Created filter hook instances.
        _admits (Dict[str, Dict[Any, BaseAdmitHookImpl]]): Created admission hook instances.

    Example:
        Register and use custom hooks:

    .. code-block:: python
        # Get factory instance (singleton)

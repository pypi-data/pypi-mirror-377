## Installation

You can install `robust_python_demo` via [pip](pip-documentation) from PyPI:

```bash
pip install robust_python_demo
```

### Installation for Development

To set up `robust_python_demo` for local development:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/56kyle/robust-python-demo.git
    cd robust-python-demo
    ```
2.  Install dependencies using [:term:`uv`](uv-documentation):
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
3.  Install pre-commit hooks:
    ```bash
    uvx nox -s pre-commit -- install
    ```

This sets up a virtual environment and installs core, development, and quality check dependencies.

## Usage

## Development Workflow

This project uses a robust set of tools for development, testing, and quality assurance. All significant automated tasks are run via [:term:`Nox`](nox-documentation), orchestrated by the central `noxfile.py`.

- **Run all checks (lint, typecheck, security):** `uvx nox -s check`
- **Run test suite with coverage:** `uvx nox -s test`
- **Build documentation:** `uvx nox -s docs`
- **Build package:** `uvx nox -s build`
- **See all available tasks:** `uvx nox -l`

Explore the `noxfile.py` and the project documentation for detailed information on the automated workflow.

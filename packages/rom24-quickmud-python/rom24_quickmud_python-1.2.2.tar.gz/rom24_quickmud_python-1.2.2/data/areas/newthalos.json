      "description": "Fine, golden dust swirls and then settles as you enter Saska's\nlibrary. Leatherbound volumes of Shakespeare rest next to paperbacks by\nTom Robbins, and Toni Morrison's _Sula_ is open on the striking table: an\nantique birdbath of polished blond wood, with glass set over the waterwell\nto give the appearance of a perfectly still pool.  Trinkets, lightly\nlifted from the mantles of the wealthy whose chimneys she cleaned, line\nthe windowsills and create space between the different sections of books.\nA crystal oil lamp seems to float on the table; a piece of paper on the\nwall, written in Saska's own lingering script, reads: \"For what is your friend\nthat you would seek him with hours to kill?  Seek him always with hours to\nlive.  --Kahlil Gibran.\"\nA cat purrs somewhere, though you cannot see the source, and you feel\nyourself tugged into the softened space. Have a seat in one of the enormous\npapasan chairs, and choose a title that strikes you.\n",

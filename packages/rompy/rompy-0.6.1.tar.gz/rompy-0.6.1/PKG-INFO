              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Introduction

Relocatable Ocean Modelling in PYthon (rompy) is a modular Python library that aims to streamline the setup, configuration, execution, and analysis of coastal ocean models. Rompy combines templated model configuration with powerful xarray-based data handling and pydantic validation, enabling users to efficiently generate model control files and input datasets for a variety of ocean and wave models. The architecture centers on high-level execution control (`ModelRun`) and flexible configuration objects, supporting both persistent scientific model state and runtime backend selection. Rompy provides unified interfaces for grids, data sources, boundary conditions, and spectra, with extensible plugin support for new models and execution environments. Comprehensive documentation, example Jupyter notebooks, and a robust logging/formatting framework make rompy accessible for both research and operational workflows. Current model support includes SWAN and SCHISM, with ongoing development for additional models and cloud/HPC backends.

Key Features:
- Modular architecture with clear separation of configuration and execution logic
- Templated, reproducible model configuration using pydantic and xarray
- Unified interfaces for grids, data, boundaries, and spectra
- Extensible plugin system for models, data sources, backends, and postprocessors
- Robust logging and formatting for consistent output and diagnostics
- Example notebooks and comprehensive documentation for rapid onboarding
- Support for local, Docker, and HPC execution backends

rompy is under active development—features, model support, and documentation are continually evolving. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

# Documentation

See https://rom-py.github.io/rompy/

# Code Formatting and Pre-commit Hooks

This repository enforces Python code formatting using [black](https://github.com/psf/black) via the pre-commit framework.

To set up pre-commit hooks locally (required for all contributors)::

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install

This will automatically check code formatting before each commit. To format your code manually, run::

    pre-commit run --all-files

All code must pass black formatting before it can be committed or merged.

# Versioning and Release

This project uses [tbump](https://github.com/dmerejkowsky/tbump) for version management.

To bump the version, run::

    tbump <new_version>

This will update the version in `src/rompy/__init__.py`, commit the change, and optionally create a git tag.

tbump is included in the development requirements (`requirements_dev.txt`).

For more advanced configuration, see `tbump.toml` in the project root.

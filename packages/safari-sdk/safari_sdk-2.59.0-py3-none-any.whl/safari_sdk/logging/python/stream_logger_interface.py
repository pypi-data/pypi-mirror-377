    IMPORTANT: stop_recording_without_saving_session() DOES NOT SAVE THE

    Note: This method is optional.  The straightforward way to record a session
    is to call start_session() and then call stop_session().

    Calling stop_recording_without_saving_session() is useful when some of the
    labels are not available at the time the recoding is stopped.  Once the
    labels have all been added (with add_session_label()) the session must be
    saved with stop_session().  If you call
    stop_recording_without_saving_session() but do not call stop_session() then
    the session WILL NOT BE SAVED.  The start_session() method will raise an
    exception if stop_recording_without_saving_session() was called but
    stop_session() was not called afterwards.

      stop_nsec: The stop time of this session.  This is typically the current

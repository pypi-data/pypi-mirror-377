  """Orchestrator API response.

  All orchestrator client API calls will return their response with this
  dataclass. The only exception is for the disconnect() API call that is not
  expected to return any data. This gives an explicit information on if the API
  call was successful or not, as well as the requested data if any.

  Attributes:
    success: Whether the API call was successful.
    error_message: Error message if the API call was not successful.
    no_more_robot_job: If true, there are no active robot jobs available to this
      robot.
    no_more_work_unit: If true, there are no active work units available to this
      robot.
    is_visual_overlay_found: If true, there are visual overlay information
      specified within the current work unit.
    project_id: Project ID for the current robot job and work unit.
    robot_id: Robot ID for the current robot job and work unit.
    robot_job: Actual RobotJob dataclass object, containing all the values
      of the current robot job.
    robot_job_id: Robot job ID for the current robot job and work unit.
    work_unit_id: Work unit ID for the current work unit.
    work_unit: Actual WorkUnit dataclass object, containing all the values
      of the current work unit.
    work_unit_stage: Current stage of the work unit, if any.
    operator_id: Current operator ID for the robot, if any.
    is_operational: Whether the robot is operational.
    server_connection: Server connection to the orchestrator server.
    visual_overlay_renderer_keys: List of keys to access specific visual overlay
      renderers.
    visual_overlay_image: Image with visual overlay drawn on it.
    artifact: Artifact information for the current work unit.
    workcell_state: Current RUI workcell state.
    robot_stage: Current Orca status of the robot.
    artifact_uri: Download URI for the specified artifact.

A CLI tool for Samsara Functions.
Streamlines local development, testing and packaging.

## Installation

It is recommended to use a separate virtual environment.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install samsara-fn
```

### Shell autocompletion

If you're using bash or zsh, you can opt-in to shell autocompletion.
To enable it, first install the package with an optional dependency set:

```bash
pip install 'samsara-fn[shell-completion]'
```

And enable autocompletions via [`argcomplete`](https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/#installation). You need to either:

1. Run this command every time you need the completion to work.

> Make sure that the virtual Python environment was already sourced before running `eval`.

```bash
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete samsara-fn)"
```

2. Enable global completion for argcomplete-supported Python scripts with a one time installation script:

```bash
activate-global-python-argcomplete
```

## Usage

The simulator provides a command-line interface.
Each command supports various options. Use `--help` with any command to see detailed usage:

```bash
samsara-fn --help
samsara-fn run manual --help
```

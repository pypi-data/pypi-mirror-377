The module *Sziplus* implements two TARSP language measures:

* Vr5+: through the function *vr5plus*:

  .. autofunction:: sastadev.Sziplus::vr5plus

  In the meantime a different implementation using macros has replaced this function,
  so it has become obsolete

* 6+: through the function *sziplus6*:

## Introduction
**scRegulate** is a powerful tool designed for the inference of transcription factor activity from single cell/nucleus RNA data using advanced generative modeling techniques. It leverages a unified learning framework to optimize the modeling of cellular regulatory networks, providing researchers with accurate insights into transcriptional regulation. With its efficient clustering capabilities, **scRegulate** facilitates the analysis of complex biological data, making it an essential resource for studies in genomics and molecular biology.

## Requirements
scRegulate is implemented in the PyTorch framework. Running scRegulate on `CUDA` is highly recommended if available.


Before installing and running scRegulate, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- **PyTorch** (version 2.0 or higher)  
  Install with the exact command from the [PyTorch “Get Started” page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for your OS, Python version and (optionally) CUDA toolkit.
- **NumPy** (version 1.23 or higher)
- **Scanpy** (version 1.9 or higher)
- **Anndata** (version 0.8 or higher)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch numpy scanpy anndata
```

## Installation

**Option 1:**  
You can install **scRegulate** via pip for a lightweight installation:

```bash
pip install scregulate
```

**Option 2:**  
Alternatively, if you want the latest, unreleased version, you can install it directly from the source on GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/YDaiLab/scRegulate.git
```

**Option 3:**  
For users who prefer Conda or Mamba for environment management, you can install **scRegulate** along with extra dependencies:

**Conda:**
```bash
conda install -c zandigohar scregulate
```

**Mamba:**
```bash
mamba create -n scRegulate -c zandigohar scregulate
```

## FAQ

**Q1: Do I need a GPU to run scRegulate?**  
No, a GPU is not required. However, using a CUDA-enabled GPU is strongly recommended for faster training and inference, especially with large datasets.

**Q2: How do I know if I can use a GPU with scRegulate?**  
There are two quick checks:

1. **System check**  
   In your terminal, run `nvidia-smi`. If you see your GPU listed (model, memory, driver version), your machine has an NVIDIA GPU with the driver installed.

2. **Python check**  
   In a Python shell, run:
   ```python
   import torch
   print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # True means PyTorch can see your GPU
   print(torch.cuda.device_count())  # How many GPUs are usable
   ```

**Q3: Can I use scRegulate with Seurat or R-based tools?**  
scRegulate is written in Python and works directly with `AnnData` objects (e.g., from Scanpy). You can convert Seurat objects to AnnData using tools like `SeuratDisk`.

**Q4: How can I visualize inferred TF activities?**  
TF activities inferred by scRegulate are stored in the `obsm` slot of the AnnData object. You can use `scanpy.pl.embedding`, `scanpy.pl.heatmap`, or export the matrix for custom plots.

**Q5: What kind of prior networks does scRegulate accept?**  
scRegulate supports user-provided gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in CSV or matrix format. These can be curated from public databases or inferred from ATAC-seq or motif analysis.

**Q6: Can I use scRegulate for multi-omics integration?**  
Not directly. While scRegulate focuses on TF activity from RNA, you can incorporate priors derived from other omics (e.g., ATAC) to **guide** the model.

**Q7: What file formats are supported?**  
scRegulate works with `.h5ad` files (AnnData format). Input files should contain gene expression matrices with proper normalization.

**Q8: How do I cite scRegulate?**  
See the [Citation](#citation) section below for the latest reference and preprint link.

**Q9: How can I reproduce the paper’s results?**  
See our [Reproducibility Guide](https://github.com/YDaiLab/scRegulate/blob/main/notebooks/Data_Preparation.ipynb) for step-by-step instructions. Then run scregulate.

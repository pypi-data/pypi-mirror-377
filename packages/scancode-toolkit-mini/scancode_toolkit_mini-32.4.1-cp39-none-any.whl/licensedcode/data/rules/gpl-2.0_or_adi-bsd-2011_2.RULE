has two license models. The first is {{[GPL-v2]}}(https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/genalyzer/blob/master/LICENSE) which is often used when linking against the GPL-v2 version of FFTW. Alternatively, if you have your own FFTW license, the [{{ADI BSD license}}](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/genalyzer/blob/master/LICENSE_ADIBSD) can be used. The provided Windows builds are GPL as they include FFTW.

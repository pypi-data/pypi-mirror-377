Intro
=====

This is a collection of generally useful functions for use with any application.

1. The diag_msg function allows you to print a message with the time and caller sequence
   added for you.
2. The doc_checker module provides an easy way to do a doctest.
3. The etrace decorator provide entry and exit tracing including passed args and
   returned values.
4. The ExcHook class handles thread exceptions for test cases to ensure that the test
   case fails.
5. The FileCatalog item allows you to map file names to their paths.
6. The print_flower_box_msg function allows you to print text in a flower box (i.e.,
   surrounded by asterisks).
7. The log_verifier allows you to verify that expected log messages have been issued.
8. The msgs item is a simple facility you can use in test cases to send messages between
   threads.
9. The Pauser class provides a pause function similar to the python sleep function, but
   with improved accuracy.
10. The verify_lib function in testlib_verifier.py allows you to verify that you are
    testing the built code and not the source.
11. The stop_watch item is a simple timing function that you can use in test cases.
12. The @time_box decorator allows you to print start, stop, and execution times.
13. The timer item provides a way to keep track of time to determine when a function has
    timed out.
14. The UniqueTS class provides a way to obtain a unique timestamp.



Examples:
=========

With **diag_msg** you can print messages with the time and caller info added automatically.

:Example: print a diagnostic message (<input> appears as the module name when run from the console)

>>> from scottbrian_utils.diag_msg import diag_msg
>>> diag_msg('this is a diagnostic message')
16:20:05.909260 <input>:1 this is a diagnostic message


With **FileCatalog**, you can code your application with file names and retrieve their paths at run time
from a catalog. This allows you to use different catalogs for the same set of files, such as one catalog for production
and another for testing. Here's as example:

>>> from scottbrian_utils.file_catalog import FileCatalog
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> prod_cat = FileCatalog({'file1': Path('/prod_files/file1.csv')})
>>> print(prod_cat.get_path('file1'))
/prod_files/file1.csv

>>> test_cat = FileCatalog({'file1': Path('/test_files/test_file1.csv')})
>>> print(test_cat.get_path('file1'))
/test_files/test_file1.csv


With **@time_box**, you can decorate a function to be sandwiched between start
time and end time messages like this:

>>> from scottbrian_utils.time_hdr import time_box

>>> @time_box
... def func2() -> None:
...      print('2 * 3 =', 2*3)

>>> func2()
<BLANKLINE>
**********************************************
* Starting func2 on Mon Jun 29 2020 18:22:50 *
**********************************************
2 * 3 = 6
<BLANKLINE>
********************************************
* Ending func2 on Mon Jun 29 2020 18:22:51 *
* Elapsed time: 0:00:00.001204             *
********************************************


With **Pauser**, you can pause execution for a specified number of seconds like this:

.. code-block:: python

   from scottbrian_utils.pauser import Pauser
   pauser = Pauser()
   pauser.pause(1.5)  # pause for 1.5 seconds

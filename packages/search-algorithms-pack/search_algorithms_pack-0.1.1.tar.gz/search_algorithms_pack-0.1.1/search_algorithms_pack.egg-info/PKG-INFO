A Python package implementing three classic searching algorithms with a simple and intuitive interface:
  1>Binary Search:- To use it one has to import BinarySearch class where by using the search method  one can search for target value.

                search(arr,target,sorted = False)
            
            Where:
                
                arr: the list to search in
                target: the value to search for
                sorted: set to True if the list is already sorted, else False

  2>Linear Search:-To use it one has to import LinearSearch class where by using the search method  one can search for target value.

                  search(arr,target)
        Where:
                
                arr: the list to search in
                target: the value to search for

  3>Jump Search:-To use it one has to import JumpSearch class where by using the search method  one can search for target value.

                search(arr,target,sorted = False)
  
        Where:
                
                arr: the list to search in
                target: the value to search for
                sorted: set to True if the list is already sorted, else False

  It's 0.1.1 version of the package and you can expect many further updates.
 To install the package, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
      
      Command:    pip install search_algorithms_pack

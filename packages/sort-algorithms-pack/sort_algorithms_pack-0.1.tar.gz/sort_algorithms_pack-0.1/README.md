# Sorting Package
This package consists of two sorting algorithms:-
      -**MergeSort**:Class with `mergeSort` method to sort a list data structure
      -**QuickSort**:Class with `quickSort` method to sort a list like data structure
      Both of the method sort the list the difference  lies in stability:
      -Merge Sort is said to be much  stable when compared with Quick or other sorting algorithms.

## Usage
import sort from sort-algorithms-pack and then inside sort there are two classes with mergeSort and quickSort methods respectively.

## Notes
Avoid directly accessing private methods like `__swap`, `__partition`, or `__Merge`.

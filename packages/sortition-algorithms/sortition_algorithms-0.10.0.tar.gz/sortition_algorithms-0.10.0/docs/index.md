Welcome to the documentation for **sortition-algorithms** - a Python library for democratic lotteries and stratified random selection.

## What is Sortition?

**Sortition** is the random selection of representatives from a larger population, designed to create panels that reflect the demographic composition of the whole group. Unlike simple random sampling, sortition uses **stratified random selection** to ensure demographic balance while maintaining the randomness essential for fairness.

This library provides algorithms for:

- **Citizens' Assemblies**: Representative groups for policy deliberation
- **Deliberative Polls**: Research panels reflecting population diversity
- **Jury Selection**: Fair selection respecting demographic quotas
- **Participatory Democracy**: Community engagement with guaranteed representation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the library
pip install sortition-algorithms

# Basic selection
python -m sortition_algorithms csv \
  --settings config.toml \
  --features-csv demographics.csv \
  --people-csv candidates.csv \
  --selected-csv selected.csv \
  --remaining-csv remaining.csv \
  --number-wanted 100
```

## Documentation Guide

### Getting Started

- **[Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)** - Get up and running in minutes with practical examples
- **[Core Concepts](concepts.md)** - Understand sortition, features, quotas, and address checking
- **[Installation & Setup](quickstart.md#installation)** - Install the library and optional dependencies

### Using the Library

- **[CLI Usage](cli.md)** - Command line interface for common operations
- **[Data Adapters](adapters.md)** - Working with CSV, Google Sheets, and custom data sources
- **[API Reference](api-reference.md)** - Extended documentation of key functions and classes
- **[Modules](modules.md)** - Complete documentation of all functions and classes

### Advanced Topics

- **[Advanced Usage](advanced.md)** - Performance optimization, complex scenarios, and troubleshooting
- **[Algorithm Deep Dive](advanced.md#algorithm-deep-dive)** - Understanding maximin, nash, and leximin algorithms

## Key Features

### üéØ **Stratified Selection**

Ensures demographic representativeness while maintaining randomness - no more accidentally all-male or all-young panels.

### üè† **Household Diversity**

Optional address checking prevents multiple selections from the same household, ensuring geographic and social diversity.

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Multiple Algorithms**

Choose from maximin (default), nash, leximin, or legacy algorithms based on your fairness requirements.

### üìä **Flexible Data Sources**

Works seamlessly with CSV files, Google Sheets, or custom data adapters for databases and APIs.

### üîç **Full Transparency**

Detailed reporting shows exactly how quotas were met and provides audit trails for democratic accountability.

## Common Use Cases

### Academic Research

```python
from sortition_algorithms import run_stratification, Settings

# Reproducible results for research
settings = Settings(
    random_number_seed=42,
    selection_algorithm="leximin"  # Strongest fairness guarantees
)
success, panels, msgs = run_stratification(features, people, 150, settings)
```

### Citizen Assemblies

```python
# Ensure household diversity for community representation
settings = Settings(
    check_same_address=True,
    check_same_address_columns=["Address", "Postcode"],
    selection_algorithm="maximin"
)
```

### Large-Scale Surveys

```bash
# Batch processing with CLI
python -m sortition_algorithms csv \
  --features-csv national_demographics.csv \
  --people-csv voter_registry.csv \
  --number-wanted 2000 \
  --settings survey_config.toml
```

## Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm   | Best For                        | Strengths                       | Requirements   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Maximin** | General use, citizen assemblies | Fair to minorities, intuitive   | None           |
| **Nash**    | Large diverse pools             | Balanced overall representation | None           |
| **Leximin** | Academic research               | Strongest fairness guarantees   | Gurobi license |
| **Legacy**  | Historical compatibility        | Backwards compatible            | None           |

This package provides a refactored, modular pipeline system that replaces
the monolithic PipelineBuilder with focused, maintainable components.

Key Components:
- PipelineBuilder: Fluent API for pipeline construction
- PipelineRunner: Pipeline execution engine
- StepExecutor: Individual step execution
- PipelineValidator: Pipeline validation and error checking
- PipelineMonitor: Metrics, reporting, and monitoring

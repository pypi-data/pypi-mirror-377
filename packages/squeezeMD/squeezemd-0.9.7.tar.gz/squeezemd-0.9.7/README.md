## Summary

*squeezeMD* provides an integrated solution for comprehensive molecular dynamics (MD) analysis.
It includes functionality for:

* in-silico mutagensis
* MD simulations
* Explorative trajectory analysis
* Interaction fingerprinting analysis
* Visualisation of the interaction surface


The workflow streamlines the analysis of complex MD simulations, enabling detailed examination of molecular interactions, stability, and conformational changes.

## Detailed Summary

### Snakefile

Serves as the backbone of the workflow, orchestrating the execution of analysis scripts.
Ensures pipeline steps are executed efficiently and in the correct order.

### Mutagenesis

Performs mutation analysis, characterizing structural and functional effects of amino acid changes.

### MD

Runs molecular dynamics simulations, revealing conformational changes and dynamics of molecules.

### Explorative Trajectory Analysis

Provides tools for trajectory inspection, helping identify key molecular events and interactions.

### Centering Trajectories

Centers and aligns trajectories, enabling accurate comparisons across simulations.

### Interaction Analysis

Analyzes molecular interactions at atom/residue level and extracts global interaction patterns.

### Interaction Fingerprints

Generates and compares interaction fingerprints, summarizing interaction motifs across simulations.

### Interaction Surface

Analyzes binding and interaction surfaces, critical for studying molecular recognition.

## Prepare AMBER PDBs

*in progress*

1. Prepare protein in Maestro
2. Convert with `pdb4amber`:

   ```bash
   pdb4amber -i input.pdb -o input.amber.pdb
   ```
3. Example PyMOL commands:

   ```python
   alter (chain A), chain='B'
   alter (chain B), resi=str(int(resi)+315)
   alter (chain C), resi=str(int(resi)+51)
   ```

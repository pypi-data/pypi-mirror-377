              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

[EODAG](https://github.com/CS-SI/eodag) backend for [stac-fastapi](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi), the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) implementation of the [STAC API spec](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec)

stac-fastapi-eodag combines the capabilities of EODAG and STAC FastAPI to provide a powerful, unified API for accessing Earth observation data from various providers.

## Disclaimer

⚠️ This project is a **WIP** and not ready for any production usage. Use at your own risks.

## Getting started

### Run stac-fastapi-eodag locally

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```shell
pip install .[server]
```

#### Running the server
Once the server is properly set up, you can start it with:

```shell
python stac_fastapi/eodag/app.py

# or run directly using uvicorn
# the uvicorn parameters configuration will not be applied
uvicorn stac_fastapi.eodag.app:app
```

By default, the EODAG HTTP server runs at port 8000.

### Run in a container

To run the server as a container:

1. Build the container image:

```shell
docker build -t eodag-fastapi .
```

2. Run the container:

```shell
docker run -p 8000:8000 eodag-fastapi
```

### Docker Compose

You can also run the server using Docker Compose:

```shell
docker compose up
```

NOTE: This will start a stac-fastapi-eodag container and an otel-collector container for the collection of metrics. The STAC API is available on `http://localhost:8080`, the metrics can be checked using `http://localhost:8000/metrics`.

### Run in Kubernetes

You can install stac-fastapi-eodag in your Kubernetes cluster with the [Helm chart in this repository](./helm/stac-fastapi-eodag/README.md).

## Configuration

stac-fastapi-eodag supports multiple environment variables to customize the deployment of your API.

### Uvicorn parameters

| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_HOST` | Bind socket to this host. Use `0.0.0.0` to make the application available from every host.| 0.0.0.0 |
| `APP_PORT` | Port from which the application is available. | 8000 |
| `RELOAD` | Enable auto-reload. **Useful for debug, should be disabled for production.** | True |
| `UVICORN_ROOT_PATH` | Used to compute the `base_url` when exposing the API on a subPath. For instance `/stac`. You should set `ROOT_PATH` (from stac-fastapi parameters) as well. **This parameter does not change the path on which the API is exposed. It only modify the links in the response body.** | "" |

The full list of available Uvicorn parameters is available from [Uvicorn settings page](https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/).

### stac-fastapi parameters

| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STAC_FASTAPI_TITLE` | Title of the API. It is displayed on the landing page. | "stac-fastapi" |
| `STAC_FASTAPI_DESCRIPTION` | Description for the API. It is displayed on the landing page. | "stac-fastapi" |
| `STAC_FASTAPI_VERSION` | It is the version number of your API instance. This is not the STAC version. It is displayed on the landing page. | 0.1 |
| `STAC_FASTAPI_LANDING_PAGE_ID` | It is a unique identifier for the landing page. It is displayed on the landing page. | "stac-fastapi" |
| `ENABLE_RESPONSE_MODELS` | Turn on response validation. | False |
| `OPENAPI_URL` | Path for the OpenAPI definition of the API. | "/api" |
| `DOCS_URL` | Path for the Swagger UI of the API. | "/api.html" |
| `ROOT_PATH` | Used to compute the `base_url` when exposing the API on a subPath. For instance `/stac`. You should set `UVICORN_ROOT_PATH` (from Uvicorn parameters) as well. **This parameter does not change the path on which the API is exposed. It only modify the links in the response body.**  | "" |

Reach to [stac-fastapi documentation](https://stac-utils.github.io/stac-fastapi/) for exhaustive documentation on stac-fastapi.

### stac-fastapi-eodag parameters

| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEBUG` | When set to `True`, set the EODAG logging level to `3`. Otherwise, set EODAG logging level to `2`. | False |
| `KEEP_ORIGIN_URL` | Keep origin as alternate URL when data-download extension is enabled. | False |
| `ORIGIN_URL_BLACKLIST` | Hide from clients items assets' origin URLs starting with URLs from the list. A string of comma separated values is expected. | "" |
| `COUNT` | Whether to run a query with a count request or not. | False |
| `FETCH_PROVIDERS` | Fetch additional collections from all EODAG providers. | False |
| `AUTO_ORDER_WHITELIST` | List of providers for which the order should be done at the same time as the download. | ["wekeo_main"] |
| `DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` | Useful to expose asset download URL in a separate domain name. | "" |

### OpenTelemetry parameters

| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Target url to which the exporter sends the metrics. | "" |
| `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` | Time interval (in milliseconds) between the start of two export attempts. | 60000 |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT` |  Timeout value for all outgoing data (traces, metrics, and logs) in milliseconds. | 10000 |

To start an otel-collector container and to connect it to an instance of STAC API the following commands can be used:

```shell
pip install .[server,telemetry]
docker run -p 4318:4318 -p 8000:8000 \
    -v ./config/otelcol_config.yml:/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml \
    otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest \
    --config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318/"
export OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL="5000"  # shorter export interval for testing
export APP_PORT=8080  # change app port because otel-collector uses 8000
python stac_fastapi/eodag/app.py
```

### EODAG parameters

EODAG configuration parameters are available from [EODAG documentation](https://eodag.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started_guide/configure.html).

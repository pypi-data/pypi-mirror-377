    This extension overrides the default GET pagination class to apply a modified
    offset parameter definition. Specifically, we enforce a non-negative integer
    constraint and potentially adjust default values.

    A new GET class (`GETOffsetPagination`) is defined to include these changes,
    so they are correctly reflected in both the request validation and the
    generated OpenAPI schema.

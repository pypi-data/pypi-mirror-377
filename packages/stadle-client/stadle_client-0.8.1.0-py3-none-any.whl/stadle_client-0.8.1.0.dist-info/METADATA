# STADLE v0.8.1

Our STADLE platform is a paradigm-shifting technology for collaborative and continuous learning combining privacy-preserving frameworks.
STADLE platform stands for Scalable, Traceable, Adaptive, Distributed Learning platform for versatile ML applications.

The purpose of stadle-client (this package) is to allow agents to interface with the [STADLE Ops](https://stadle.ai/) platform in order to perform federated learning.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://stadle-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for information on using STADLE for FL.

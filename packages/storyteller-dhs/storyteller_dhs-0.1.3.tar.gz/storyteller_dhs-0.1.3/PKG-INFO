3. **Install Twine (if not installed)**  
   ```bash
   pip install twine
   ```

4. **Upload to Test PyPI (optional)**  
   ```bash
   twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
   ```
   Verify the package works by installing from Test PyPI.

5. **Upload to PyPI (production)**  
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

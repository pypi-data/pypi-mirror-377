* Bug fixes and improvements.

6.1.0 (November 2023)
---------------------
* Allow direct replacement of a stage in a pipeline. This is achieved through the ``copy_inputs`` & ``copy_outputs`` methods under the :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.SchSdcStage` and :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.SchStStage` classes respectively.

* Service configurations for Stages have now been re-homed under the ``configuration`` stage attribute. However, service configurations for Stages will continue to be accessible via the ``services`` attribute.

* Bug fixes and improvements

6.0.0 (August 2023)
-------------------
* Existing pipelines and their stages are now directly editable from the SDK. Previously the SDK only supported creation of new Pipelines and publishing those to the Platform for the first time. With this change, instances of :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.SchSdcStage` and :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.SchStStage` can be added, removed, replaced, connected and disconnected using only the SDK - enabling programmatic pipeline editing at scale.

* Top level configurations for :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Pipeline`, :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.SchSdcStage`, and :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.SchStStage` have begun to be moved under the ``configuration`` attribute. The configuration properties will still be accessible as top-level attributes until the next major release.

* Setting :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.st_models.Stage.output_lanes` or :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.sdc_models.Stage.output_lanes` is now deprecated.

* The :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.SchSdcStage` ``Stream Selector`` has been updated to not require ``outputLane`` while defining ``predicates``.

  .. note::
    While heavily discouraged, it is still possible to define a particular ``outputLane`` for each of the ``predicates`` to avoid inconsistencies.

* :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.ScheduledTask` actions are now refactored under :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub`.

  .. warning::
    This will affect usage of SDK and the following functions have been removed and replaced:
    :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.ScheduledTask.resume`, :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.ScheduledTask.pause`, :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.ScheduledTask.kill` and :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.ScheduledTask.delete`
    are now replaced by :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.resume_scheduled_tasks`, :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.pause_scheduled_tasks`, :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.kill_scheduled_tasks` and :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.delete_scheduled_tasks` respectively.

    Please refer to the documentation for the correct, updated usage.

* :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.PipelineBuilder.import_pipeline` has been refactored to accept a parameter of type :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Pipeline` instead of a :py:obj:`dict` of pipeline definitions. This allows using an existing pipeline as the base for creating a new pipeline via the :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.PipelineBuilder` class.

* :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.engine_configurations` has been refactored to :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.engine_versions`.

* Deployment attribute :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Deployment.engine_instances` has been renamed to :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Deployment.desired_instances`

* Bug fixes and improvements

5.2.1 (May 2023)
----------------
* Fixed a TypeError Exception when filtering jobs by status in ControlHub.

5.2.0 (April 2023)
---------------------

  to the :ref:`StreamSets SDK Deployments Usage Documentation <Kubernetes Deployments>` or :ref:`StreamSets SDK Environments Usage Documentation <Kubernetes Environments>` for further details.

* Support for SAQL (StreamSets Advanced Query Language) Saved Searches has been added. Refer to the :ref:`StreamSets Search Documentation <saql_saved_searches>` for further details.

* Support for Draft Runs has been added. Refer to the :ref:`StreamSets SDK Run Documentation <draft_runs>` for further details.

* The :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.Jobs.get_all` method now supports filtering by the ``job_id`` parameter.

* The :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.EC2Deployment` class directly uses the default instance profile of its :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.AWSEnvironment` class

* Bug fixes and improvements.

5.1.0 (December 2022)
---------------------
* Support for StreamSets Advanced Query Language has been added for Pipelines, Fragments, and Jobs. Refer
  to the :ref:`StreamSets SDK Search Documentation <search_for_objects>` for further details.

* The :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.engines.get_all` method now supports filtering by the ``id`` parameter.

* Bug fixes and improvements.

5.0.0 (August 2022)
-------------------
* The :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.validate_pipeline` method now supports validating SDC and Transformer
  pipelines.

* Changing the name of a :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Pipeline` instance is now possible by setting the ``name``
  attribute of the instance and passing it to :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.publish_pipeline`.

* Improved the usability of the :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.ApiCredentialBuilder` class and its interaction
  with the :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.add_api_credential` method.

  .. note::
    Please refer to the documentation for the correct, updated usage.

* The :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.User` and :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Group` classes have received
  several improvements including:

  * The :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.User.groups` and :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Group.users` attributes
    have been improved to return :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Group` and :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.User`
    instances (respectively) rather than just ID values.

  .. warning::
     This will affect existing SDK usage of the :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.User.groups` and
     :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Group.users` attributes. Please refer to the documentation for the correct,
     updated usage.

* The :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.DataCollector` and :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Transformer` classes
  have been refactored into a single class which houses the functionality for both:
  :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Engine`. Subsequently, the :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.data_collectors`
  and :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.transformers` attributes now utilize the :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Engines`
  class instead.

  .. warning::
     This will affect existing SDK usage of the :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.data_collectors` and
     :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.transformers` attributes, as these will both now return instances of the
     :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Engine` class. Please refer to the documentation for the correct,
     updated usage.

* Pagination improvements have been made for various classes

* When retrieving :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Job` instances via :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.jobs` and supplying a ``job_tag`` value, including the organization that the job tag belongs to is no longer required.

  .. warning::
     This will affect existing SDK usage of the :py:attr:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.jobs` attribute. Please refer to the documentation for the correct, updated usage.

* Arguments and attributes that were marked as deprecated in the previous release have been removed.

* Bug fixes and improvements


4.3.0 (August 2022)
-------------------
* Added support for using the SDK on Python 3.10

* :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Users` and :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Groups` instances can now be
  filtered on specific text values via the ``filter_text`` parameter, as seen in the UI

* Bug fixes and improvements


4.2.1 (July 2022)
-----------------

  instances.

* Fixes a bug in the naming convention used for pipelines created via the :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.ControlHub.test_pipeline_run`
  method.

* Fixes a bug that prevented users from supplying a ``'.'`` (period) character in the ``group_id`` when creating a group
  via the :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.GroupBuilder.build` method.


4.2.0 (May 2022)
----------------
* Programmatic User creation and management has been added

* Pagination and "lazy" loading improvements have been made to various classes

* The Group class has been refactored slightly to better match the experience seen in the UI

.. note::
  When filtering the :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Groups` objects in StreamSets Platform, the ``id`` argument has
  been replaced by ``group_id`` to match the :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Group` class's representation. Please
  refer to the documentation for the correct, updated usage.

* The :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.DeploymentBuilder.build` and :py:meth:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.EnvironmentBuilder.build`
  methods no longer require the ``deployment_type`` or ``environment_type`` arguments to be supplied

.. warning::
  The ``deployment_type`` and ``environment_type`` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  Please refer to the documentation for the correct, updated usage.

* The :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Deployments` and :py:class:`streamsets.sdk.sch_models.Environments` classes
  can now be filtered on ``deployment_id`` and ``environment_id`` respectively, instead of ``id``

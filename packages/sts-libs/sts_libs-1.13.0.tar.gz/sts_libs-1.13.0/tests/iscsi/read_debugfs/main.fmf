summary: Tests recursive reading of files in the debugfs directory for a specific
    driver
description: |
    This test verifies that the debugfs directory for a specified driver can be recursively read and does not trigger
    system crash.
    It checks if the module is loaded, ensures debugfs is mounted, and then reads all files in the debugfs directory.
    Note: this is a reproducer of RHEL-8112.

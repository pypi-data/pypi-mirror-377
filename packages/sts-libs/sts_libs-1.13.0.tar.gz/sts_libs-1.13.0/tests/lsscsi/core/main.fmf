summary: Validate lsscsi command-line utility functionality
description: |
  This module contains comprehensive test cases for the lsscsi command-line tool,
  which is used to list information about SCSI devices. The tests validate various
  command-line options, output formats, and device enumeration behavior.

  Features:
  - Tests core functionality like version checks, help messages, and basic listings
  - Validates device node formatting (-d), SCSI generic paths (-g), and classic format (-c)
  - Verifies advanced features: LUN hex formatting (-x), device IDs (-i), capacity (-s)
  - Checks transport layer details (-t), protection modes (-P), and logical unit names
  - Ensures correct handling of combined options (-dgkxisv, -Lptvvv)
  - Uses regex patterns to validate output formats (MM_PATTERN, SG_PATTERN, etc.)
  - Parameterized testing with configurable SCSI host/target counts

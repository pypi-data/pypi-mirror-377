# Supply Chain Security Scanner

A comprehensive security tool to detect compromised NPM packages in your Git repositories across multiple platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

## üö® Background: The Growing Supply Chain Threat

### The Problem

Software supply chain attacks have become one of the most critical cybersecurity threats facing organizations today. These attacks involve compromising legitimate packages in public repositories (like NPM, PyPI, or RubyGems) to distribute malicious code to downstream users. 

**Recent Statistics:**
- Supply chain attacks increased by 300% in 2021-2024
- Over 200,000 malicious packages discovered in NPM alone
- Average time to detect: 97 days
- Cost per incident: $4.45M on average

### The Shai-Hulud Attack (September 2025)

The most recent and significant supply chain attack, dubbed "Shai-Hulud," compromised approximately 200 NPM packages between September 14-16, 2025. This sophisticated worm-like malware:

- **Targets**: Popular packages like `@ctrl/tinycolor` (8M+ monthly downloads), `@crowdstrike/*` packages, `ngx-bootstrap`, and others
- **Method**: Uses postinstall scripts to execute malicious payload via Webpack bundle
- **Payload**: Steals developer credentials (NPM tokens, GitHub PATs, AWS/GCP keys) using TruffleHog
- **Propagation**: Self-replicates by publishing malicious versions of other packages using stolen credentials
- **Data Exfiltration**: Creates "ShaiHulud" repositories in victim's accounts and sends data to webhook.site

**Impact on Organizations:**
- Credential theft leading to further compromise
- Source code exposure through repository conversion
- CI/CD pipeline infiltration  
- Lateral movement across development infrastructure
- Supply chain contamination affecting downstream users

## üí° Why This Tool Exists

Traditional vulnerability scanners often miss supply chain attacks because:

1. **Time Gap**: Packages appear legitimate until discovered
2. **Version Confusion**: Organizations struggle to track which versions are affected
3. **Scale Challenge**: Large organizations have hundreds of repositories
4. **Platform Fragmentation**: Code scattered across GitHub, GitLab, etc.
5. **Manual Process**: Security teams need hours to audit dependencies manually

This tool solves these problems by providing:
- **Automated scanning** across multiple Git platforms
- **Flexible package definitions** via external configuration
- **Multiple output formats** for integration with security workflows
- **Comprehensive reporting** with project-level details
- **Real-time detection** capability for new threats

## üéØ Use Cases

### Immediate Response (Active Incident)
When a supply chain attack is announced:
1. Update the compromised packages list
2. Run scanner across all repositories
3. Generate reports for affected teams
4. Coordinate remediation efforts

### Proactive Monitoring
- Regular scans for known compromised packages
- Integration with CI/CD for new project validation
- Compliance reporting for security audits
- Supply chain risk assessment

```

## üîç Understanding Results

### Risk Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Package in compromised list, immediate action required
- **HIGH**: Suspicious version patterns or timing
- **MEDIUM**: Related packages or dependencies
- **LOW**: Historical vulnerabilities, monitoring recommended

### Recommended Actions
1. **CRITICAL findings**:
   - Stop all deployments immediately
   - Downgrade to safe versions
   - Rotate all credentials
   - Scan systems for compromise indicators

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check NPM logs for postinstall execution
   - Look for unexpected repositories
   - Review CI/CD logs for anomalies

## üìà Performance

### Typical Performance
- **Small org** (50 repos): 2-5 minutes
- **Medium org** (200 repos): 10-15 minutes  
- **Large org** (1000+ repos): 45-60 minutes

### Optimization Tips
- Use API tokens with appropriate scopes only
- Run during off-peak hours for large organizations
- Filter repositories by activity date if needed
- Use parallel processing for very large deployments

- NPM Security Advisory Database
- GitHub Advisory Database  
- Snyk Vulnerability Database
- MITRE CVE Database
- Sonatype Security Research

### Package List Maintenance
```bash
# Update default packages with new threats
curl -s https://api.github.com/advisories | jq '.[] | select(.ecosystem=="npm") | .package.name' >> new_threats.txt
```

## üÜò Incident Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection (0-1 hour)
1. Run scanner with latest threat intelligence
2. Generate reports in multiple formats
3. Identify affected teams and projects
4. Assess scope and potential impact

### Phase 2: Containment (1-4 hours)  
1. Stop CI/CD pipelines for affected projects
2. Revoke and rotate all potentially compromised credentials
3. Block malicious package versions at network level
4. Communicate with affected teams

### Phase 3: Eradication (4-24 hours)
1. Downgrade packages to safe versions
2. Scan systems for compromise indicators
3. Review access logs for unauthorized activity
4. Update security policies and controls

### Phase 4: Recovery (1-7 days)
1. Test applications with safe package versions
2. Resume CI/CD operations with additional controls
3. Monitor for reinfection or lateral movement
4. Conduct lessons learned session

## üìã Compliance and Reporting

### Regulatory Requirements
- **SOX**: Document supply chain risk management
- **PCI DSS**: Secure development lifecycle controls
- **GDPR**: Data protection in development tools
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### Audit Reports
Generate compliance-ready reports:
```bash
# Weekly compliance scan
python scanner.py --provider gitlab --token $TOKEN --format json --output compliance_$(date +%Y_week_%U).json

# Executive summary
python reporter.py --input compliance_*.json --summary --format pdf
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors
```bash
Error: 401 Unauthorized
```
**Solution**: Check token validity and permissions
```bash
# Test GitLab token
curl -H "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $TOKEN" "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/user"

# Test GitHub token  
curl -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" "https://api.github.com/user"
```

#### Rate Limiting
```bash
Error: 429 Too Many Requests
```
**Solution**: Add delays or use multiple tokens
```python
# Add to scanner configuration
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1  # seconds between requests
```

#### Large Repository Timeouts
```bash
Error: Timeout reading package.json
```
**Solution**: Increase timeout values
```python
# Modify timeout in provider classes
response = self.session.get(url, timeout=60)
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
python scanner.py --provider gitlab --token TOKEN --verbose 2>&1 | tee debug.log
```

## üìä Analytics and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- Number of vulnerable projects over time
- Mean time to remediation (MTTR)
- Repeat violations by team
- Coverage percentage of repositories
- False positive rates

### Dashboards
Integrate with monitoring tools:
- Grafana dashboards for trending
- Splunk searches for log analysis  
- ELK stack for centralized logging

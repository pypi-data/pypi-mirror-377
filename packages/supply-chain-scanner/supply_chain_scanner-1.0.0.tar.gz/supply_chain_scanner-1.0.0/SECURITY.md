## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Supply Chain Security Scanner, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security issues by emailing: **security@community.org**

Include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Investigation**: We will investigate and work on a fix
4. **Resolution**: We will notify you when the issue is resolved
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate responsible disclosure with you

### Security Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Patch within 7 days
- **High severity**: Patch within 14 days  
- **Medium/Low severity**: Patch within 30 days

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Token Security
- **Never commit API tokens to version control**
- Store tokens in environment variables or secure credential stores
- Use tokens with minimal required permissions
- Rotate tokens regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Monitor token usage in audit logs

#### Network Security
- Use HTTPS URLs for all Git provider endpoints
- Consider using corporate proxies if required
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
- Implement rate limiting to avoid service blocking

#### Data Protection
- Review output files before sharing
- Avoid storing scan results in public repositories
- Use secure channels for transmitting scan results
- Implement data retention policies for scan results

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- All dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- Regular security scanning with Bandit
- Input validation for all user-provided data
- No storage of sensitive information in logs

#### API Security
- All API calls use HTTPS
- Proper error handling to avoid information leakage
- Rate limiting compliance
- Token validation before use

## Known Security Considerations

### Data Collection
The scanner only accesses:
- Repository metadata (names, URLs, IDs)
- package.json file contents
- No source code or sensitive files are read

### Network Communications
- All API calls use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- No data is sent to third-party services
- No telemetry or tracking implemented

### Local Storage
- Scan results are stored locally only
- No caching of API responses
- No persistent storage of credentials

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Token-based authentication only
- No password storage or handling
- Support for environment variable configuration
- Automatic token validation

### Authorization
- Respects Git provider permission models
- Only accesses repositories user has access to
- No privilege escalation attempts
- Minimal required API scopes

### Audit Trail
- Comprehensive logging of all operations
- Timestamps for all scan activities
- Error logging for troubleshooting
- No logging of sensitive information

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Our Commitment
- We will investigate all legitimate reports
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
  - Report vulnerabilities responsibly
  - Do not access data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the issue
  - Do not disrupt our services or other users
  - Follow coordinated disclosure practices

### Recognition
- We maintain a security researchers acknowledgment page
- We provide CVE numbers for confirmed vulnerabilities
- We offer public recognition (with permission)

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes and changelog
- Email notifications to maintainers
- Security mailing list (coming soon)

### Update Process
1. Security patches are released as soon as possible
2. Updates include detailed security advisory
3. Backward compatibility maintained when possible
4. Migration guides provided for breaking changes

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards
- Follows OWASP secure coding practices
- Implements defense in depth principles
- Regular security assessments
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring

### Privacy Compliance
- Minimal data collection
- No personal information processing
- GDPR compliance considerations
- Data retention policies

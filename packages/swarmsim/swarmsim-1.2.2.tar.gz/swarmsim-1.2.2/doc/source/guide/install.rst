This page describes how to install RobotSwarmSimulator.

Setting up your environment
===========================

.. note::
   If you're on Ubuntu or a Debian-based Linux distribution, you may need to use ``pyenv``
   to install :fab:`python` Python 3.11 or later.
   See the `pyenv installation instructions <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation>`_.
   You need to do this before creating the virtual environment.

.. important::
   :fab:`windows` Windows users: please **DO NOT** use Python from the :fab:`microsoft` Microsoft Store.
   Instead, download and install the latest version of Python from the `Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
   Make sure to check the box to add Python to your PATH:

   .. card::
      :far:`square-check` Add Python to PATH

   If you didn't do this when installing Python, you'll need to add it manually.
   See :ref:`python:setting-envvars` or `How to Add Python to PATH <https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/>`_.
   Or, uninstall and reinstall Python (You may need to re-\ ``pip install`` system Python packages).


To install RobotSwarmSimulator, we recommend using `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_.

.. dropdown:: Install UV for faster installs
   :color: secondary
   :open:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :caption: Install ``uv`` <https://github.com/pyuv/uv> for faster installs

      pip install uv -U

   The ``-U`` flag is shorthand for ``--upgrade``.
   
   You can preface most ``pip install`` commands with ``uv`` for *much* faster installation.
   ``uv pip install`` may not work for some packages. If you get an error, try using regular ``pip install`` first.

The recommended way to install RobotSwarmSimulator is with a **virtual environment**.

Virtual environments are isolated Python environments that allow you to install
packages without affecting your system Python installation.

First, you need to choose a location to store your virtual environment.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir swarm
    cd swarm

.. tab-set::
   :class: sd-width-content-min
   :sync-group: uv

   .. tab-item:: uv
      :sync: uv     

      .. code-block:: bash
         :caption: Create a virtual environment

         uv venv
         

   .. tab-item:: pip
      :sync: pip

      .. code-block:: bash
         :caption: Create a virtual environment

         pip install virtualenv
         virtualenv .venv --prompt .


This will create a virtual environment ``.venv`` folder in your current directory.

Now, we need to activate the virtual environment.

.. _activate-venv:

Activating the virtual environment
----------------------------------

Once you have created your virtual environment, you need to activate it.

Make sure you're in the directory where you created the virtual environment.
In this example we're in the ``swarms/`` folder.

.. tab-set::
   :class: sd-width-content-min
   :sync-group: os

   .. tab-item:: :fab:`windows` Windows
      :sync: windows

      Make sure you're in the directory where you created the virtual environment, which should
      contain ``Scripts\\`` and ``Lib\\`` and ``pyvenv.cfg`` among other things. You can see what's
      in your current folder by typing ``dir`` in the command prompt.

      .. code-block:: bat

         .venv\Scripts\activate

   .. tab-item:: :fab:`linux` Linux / :fab:`apple` macOS / :fab:`windows`\ :fab:`linux` WSL
      :sync: posix

      Make sure you're in the directory where you created the virtual environment, which should
      have a ``bin/`` and ``lib/`` and ``pyvenv.cfg`` among other things. You can see what's
      in your current folder by typing ``ls`` in the command prompt.

      .. code-block:: bash

         source .venv/bin/activate


.. include:: activating_others.rst


You should see the name of your virtual environment in parentheses at the beginning of your terminal prompt:

.. tab-set::
   :class: sd-width-content-min
   :sync-group: os

   .. tab-item:: :fab:`windows` Windows
      :sync: windows

      .. code-block:: doscon

         (swarms) C:\swarms> 

   .. tab-item:: :fab:`linux` Linux / :fab:`apple` macOS / :fab:`windows`\ :fab:`linux` WSL
      :sync: posix

      .. code-block:: bash

         (swarms) user@host:~/swarms$

To deactivate the virtual environment, use the ``deactivate`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   deactivate

.. _regular-install:

Installing RobotSwarmSimulator
==============================

To install RobotSwarmSimulator, we recommend using `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_.
You can preface most ``pip install`` commands with ``uv`` for *much* faster installation.

.. admonition:: Don't forget to activate the virtual environment!

   :ref:`activate-venv`

.. tab-set::
   :class: sd-width-content-min
   :sync-group: uv

   .. tab-item:: uv
      :sync: uv

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install uv
         uv pip install swarmsim

      .. note::
         
         It's possible to install RobotSwarmSimulator to the global system Python installation
         with the ``--system`` flag. However, this is not recommended, as it may cause
         conflicts with other packages.

   .. tab-item:: pip
      :sync: pip

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install swarmsim


While you're here, let's also install ``pyreadline3`` which makes the ``python`` shell much more user-friendly.

.. tab-set::
   :class: sd-width-content-min
   :sync-group: uv

   .. tab-item:: uv
      :sync: uv

      .. code-block:: bash

         uv pip install pyreadline3

   .. tab-item:: pip
      :sync: pip

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install pyreadline3


If the installation was successful, you should be able to open a ``python`` shell and import the package:

.. code-block:: python-console
   :caption: ``python``

   Python 3.11.0 (or newer)
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> import swarmsim
   >>> 

If you installed ``pyreadline3``, you can exit the ``python`` shell with :kbd:`Ctrl+C` to stop
currently running commands and then :kbd:`Ctrl+D` or ``quit()`` to quit the python REPL.

Development Installations
=========================

If you intend to contribute to or modify RobotSwarmSimulator, you should follow the
:doc:`installation guide for development </devel/install>` instead.

WSL Installation
================

Although RobotSwarmSimulator works natively on :fab:`windows` Windows, you can also install RobotSwarmSimulator
in a :fab:`windows`\ :fab:`linux` Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment.

First, you need to install WSL.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   install-wsl

Then, follow the :ref:`regular-install` or :doc:`/devel/install` instructions as if you were on Linux.

RobotSwarmSimulator |release| documentation
===========================================

RobotSwarmSimulator is a Python package for simulating 2D robot swarms.

This documentation covers the https://github.com/kenblu24/RobotSwarmSimulator fork.

.. warning::
   Both the documentation and the simulator software are under heavy development.
   Expect holes in documentation and bugs aplenty.

Get Started
===========

   .. tab-item:: pip

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install swarmsim

   .. tab-item:: uv

      We recommend using `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ to install the package. If you don't have ``uv``, check out the more detailed :doc:`installation guide <guide/install>`.

      .. code-block:: bash

         uv pip install swarmsim

         guide/install

For more detailed instructions, see the
:doc:`installation guide <guide/install>`
, which covers virtual environments, faster installation with uv, and more.

Then, you can import the :py:mod:`swarmsim` package:

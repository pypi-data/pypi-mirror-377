To generate the documentation, you need to have installed the package with the `docs` extra:

```bash
pip install .[docs]
```

Then, you can generate the documentation with:

```bash
sphinx-build -M html docs/source/ docs/build/
```

The documentation will be generated in the `docs/build/html` directory.

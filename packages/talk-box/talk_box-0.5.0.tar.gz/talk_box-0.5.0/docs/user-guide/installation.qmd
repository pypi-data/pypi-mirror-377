Get Talk Box up and running in your Python environment with these simple installation steps.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **pip** or **conda** package manager

## Basic Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install talk-box
```

### Option 2: Development Installation

For the latest features or to contribute to development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rich-iannone/talk-box.git

## AI Provider Setup

Talk Box integrates with multiple AI providers. You'll need to set up at least one provider to use real AI models.

## Using a `.env` file (Recommended)

For security and convenience, you can store all your API keys in a `.env` file in your project directory:

1. Create a file named `.env` in your project root
2. Add your API keys (one per line):
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key-here
   ```
3. Install python-dotenv: `pip install python-dotenv`
4. Load in Python:
   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()  # Loads variables from .env file
   ```

**Important:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing API keys to version control!

# The exception reasons that will force switching from events to polling
# API_AttributePollingNotStarted - the attribute does not support events.
#     Don't try to resubscribe.
# API_DSFailedRegisteringEvent - same exception then the one above but higher
#     in the stack
# API_NotificationServiceFailed - Problems in notifd, it was not able to
#     register the event.
# API_EventChannelNotExported - the notifd is not running
# API_EventTimeout - after a successfull register the the device server
#     and/or notifd shuts down/crashes
# API_CommandNotFound - Added on request from ESRF (Matias Guijarro). They have
#     a DS in java (doesn't have events) and the only way they
#     found to fix the event problem was to add this exception
#     type here. Maybe in future this will be solved in a better way
# API_BadConfigurationProperty - the device server is not running

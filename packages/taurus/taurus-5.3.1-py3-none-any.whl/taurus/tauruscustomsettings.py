#: Widget alternatives. Some widgets may have alternative implementations.
#: The different implementations are registered in
#: entry point groups (``taurus.plot.alt``, ``taurus.trend.alt``, ...) and they
#: are tried in alphabetical order of their registered entry point names
#: (the first one that works is used). You can restrict the set of available
#: implementation alternatives to be tried (or even just select a given
#: alternative) by setting the corresponding ``*_ALT`` variable with a name
#: regexp pattern that must be matched by the entry point name in order to be
#: tried. For example, to force the ``taurus_pyqtgraph`` implementation for the
#: plots, set ``PLOT_ALT = "tpg"``.
#:
#: The following variables control the alternatives:
#:
#: - ``PLOT_ALT``
#: - ``TREND_ALT``
#: - ``TREND2D_ALT``
#: - ``IMAGE_ALT``
#:
#: Leaving the variable undefined is equivalent to setting it to `".*"`

#: attribute type, but sometimes a custom formatter is needed.
#: IMPORTANT: setting this option in this file will affect ALL widgets
#: of ALL applications (which is probably **not** what you want, since it
#: may have unexpected effects in some applications).
#: Consider using the API for modifying this on a per-widget or per-class
#: basis at runtime, or using the related `--default-formatter` parameter
#: from TaurusApplication, e.g.:
#:     $ taurus form MODEL --default-formatter='{:2.3f}'
#: The formatter can be a python format string or the name of a formatter

#: - Setting to ``True`` (or not setting it) makes the ``TangoAttribute``

#: - Setting to ``False`` avoids this subscription, which prevents issues such
#:   as https://gitlab.com/taurus-org/taurus/-/issues/1118

#: Implicit optparse legacy support:
#: In taurus < 4.6.5 if ``TaurusApplication`` did not receive an explicit
#: ``cmd_line_parser`` keyword argument, it implicitly used a
#: ``optparse.OptionParser`` instance. This was inconvenient because it forced
#: the user to explicitly pass ``cmd_line_parser=None`` when using other
#: mechanisms such as ``click`` or ``argparse`` to parse CLI options.

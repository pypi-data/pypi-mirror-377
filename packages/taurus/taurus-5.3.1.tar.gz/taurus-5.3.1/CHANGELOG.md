# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project uses [PEP440] versioning where released versions start with 3 dot
separated numbers (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), which should be interpreted as
their homonym components in [Semantic Versioning].

This file follows the formats and conventions from [keepachangelog.com]

Note: changes in the [support-3.x] branch (which was split from
the master branch after [3.7.1] and maintained in parallel to the
develop branch) won't be reflected in this file.

## [5.3.1] - 2025-09-15
Hotfix to fix #1442

### Fixed
- Restored dot-separated logger names to preserve parent/child hierarchy in Python logging. This ensures handler inheritance and log propagation. The issue was detected as missing output in Sardana Spock CLI (!1370, #1442)

## [5.3.0] - 2025-08-24
[Jul25 milestone](https://gitlab.com/taurus-org/taurus/-/milestones/21)

Release adding Qt6 support and dropping support for python<3.7 and PyTango<9.2.0.

### Added
- Qt6 compatibility across the codebase, including support for PyQt6 and PySide6, while retaining support for PyQt5 and PySide2. PyQt5 remains the default binding (!1300, #1299)
- Support for custom Tango device state color policies via the TANGO_DEVICE_STATE_COLOR_POLICY setting. `Taurus` policy (default) preserves current colors, and a new `Tango` policy is available to match Tango ATK colors. More policies can be added in the future (!1361, #1391)

### Changed
- Increased minimum supported PyTango version to 9.2.0 (!1347)
- Updated minimum Python version to 3.7 (!1364)
- TaurusForm now uses `TaurusModelSelector` instead of `TaurusModelChooser` for model selection, enabling plugin discovery (!1294, #1353)

### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect pending operations display for Tango attributes pushing change events from code. This is caused due to `w_value` not being updated in the received event after write. Taurus now always uses `write_read_attribute()` to ensure consistency (!1360)
- Avoid None on initial read state in Tango device (!1362)
- Fix setting model in taurus form using the full Tango host when no `TANGO_HOST` variable is set (!1363, #1421)
- Prevent TaurusValue to return a non-list result as default read widget and to destroy an unexisting widget (!1323, #1379)


## [5.2.4] - 2025-04-29
Unofficial release with bug fixes and small additions.

IMPORTANT: this is a not-fully-official release: it did not undergo the usual
release manual tests on various platforms and it is not merged into the stable
branch. However, it has been used in production in ALBA for some weeks already
without issues.

### Added
- New dropdown widget for handling Tango DevEnum attributes. (!1352)
- Support for plotting of spectra and images in TaurusNeXusBrowser. (!1351, #1410)

## [5.2.3] - 2025-02-25
Unofficial release with bug fixes and small additions.

IMPORTANT: this is a not-fully-official release: it did not undergo the usual
release manual tests on various platforms and it is not merged into the stable
branch. However, it has been used in production in ALBA for some weeks already
without issues.

### Fixed
- Allow TaurusPollingTimer to end its infinite loop before removing the object so it doesn't create orphan threads. (!1345)
- Problems updating bgRole color in TaurusLabels (!1344, #1400)
- Fixed right-click context menu action in TaurusGraphicsScene. Now it correctly sets the model in TaurusDevicePanel launched from JDraw synoptics (!1343, #1399)

## [5.2.2] - 2025-01-22
Unofficial release with bug fixes and small additions.

IMPORTANT: this is a not-fully-official release: it did not undergo the usual
release manual tests on various platforms and it is not merged into the stable
branch. However, it has been used in production in ALBA for some weeks already
without issues.

### Added
- Added support for Lima video `imageMode`=19 (YUV422PACKED) considering it the same as `imageMode`=16 (YUV422) for decoding. (!1339)
- Documented API incompatibility between guiqwt and guidata for PyQt<5.15 in known issues. (!1340, #1396)

### Fixed
- Removed guiqwt CLI command causing wrong output of `taurus --help` option. (!1336, #1389)
- Issue with `TaurusAttribute` value comparison failing due to `numpy.allclose` default tolerance. This caused some `wvalue` changes to not be identified correctly. (!1338, #1394)
- Properly close `TaurusGraphicsScene` thread when its parent widget is destroyed. (!1328)

## [5.2.1] - 2024-12-20
Unnoficial release with bug fixes and small additions.

IMPORTANT: this is a not-fully-official release: it did not undergo the usual
release manual tests on various platforms and it is not merged into the stable
branch. However, it has been used in production in ALBA for some weeks already
without issues.

### Added
- Added option to disable tango event subscription. This behavior can be toggled via custom setting, cli option and method in TangoFactory. Using the CLI or TangoFactory method will disable the subscription to all events regardless of the custom settings (!1326)
    - CLI: add --disable-tango-event-subscription
    - TangoFactory: call set_tango_event_subscription_disabled(True)
    - Custom setting: set TANGO_EVENTS_TO_SUBSCRIBE=[].
  Configuration events are not affected by these options, for them set the already existing custom setting TANGO_AUTOSUBSCRIBE_CONF=False
- Close TaurusApplication on CTRL+C (SIGINT signal) (!1319)
- Added basic support for Tango `DevEnum` type using DataType.Integer (!1331, #1342)

### Changed
- Prepend taurus path to PYQTDESIGNERPATH instead of overwriting it (!1324, #1380)
- CI pipeline tests: Removed Debian stretch. Added Debian bookworm. (!1325)

### Fixed
- Resolved issue with multiple TangoDBs that prevented access to databases not defined in TANGO_HOST (!1330, #1387)
- Fixed exception on eval attributes caused by None values on startup (!1335, #1390)
- Forced int type when setting Qt.QColor in JDraw (!1327)

## [5.2.0] - 2024-10-25
[Oct24 milestone](https://gitlab.com/taurus-org/taurus/-/milestones/20)

Release containing improvements related with TEP21 (Taurus Performance Optimizations).
It includes some potential breaking changes for specific use cases.

### Added
- Support for multiple TangoDB. (!1270, #929)
- Solve TaurusWheel exception.(!1278, #1249)
- Improvements in CI pipeline. (!1282, !1310)
- Taurus designer .ui files can now be opened with _taurus loadui uifile.ui_ command. (!1281)
- Add the possibility to save TaurusMainWindow state from _File_ contextual menu (!1291, #1343)
- Add a new TaurusCustomSetting able to manage the default behaviour of save state method (!1291, #1343)
- Support for NumPy 2.0 (!1293, #1352)
- Solve ValuechangedSignal not emited (!1279, #1338)

### Fixed
- Solve memory leak when attributes are not avalaible. (!1276, #1318)
- Make `PyQtWebEngine` mandatory dependency for `taurus-qt` to fix issues
  with Taurus Manual panel when the dependency is not installed (!1272, #1287)
- **Potential breaking change**: The deviceState of TaurusDevice corresponding to non existent tango devices, is now Undefined instead of NotReady. The deviceState of TaurusDevice corresponding to a running tango device in UNKNOWN state, is now NotReady instead of Undefined. This may break scripts that do something according to NotReady or Undefined deviceStatus. (!1251, #1223)
- Avoid an unnecessary read in ATTR_CONF_EVENT callback. (!1248/!1288, #1275). This read is necessary so the attributes without event get an initial value and doesn't depend on the polling thread, so it was moved to the subscription failure (!1289)
- Update color names to match Web colors. The colors that are not exactly a Web color, are named "Taurus - x", where x is the most similar Web color (!1287)
- Avoid multiple _getElementAlias()_ calls (!1283, #1305)
- Avoid multiple _fqdn_no_alias()_ calls (!1286, #1306)
- Fix error when loading an xml from a previously created gui using the _taurus newgui_ wizard (!1296, #1333/#1200)
- Fix incorrect taurus-h5file requirement (!1297, #1335)
- Fix example in TaurusPlot documentation (!1298, #1349)
- Fix the bug where the polling thread starts without having anything to poll, causing an initial sleep. Fix the bug (related to the previous one) where timeout attributes caused a 9s GUI startup. (!1306, #1278)
- Fix TangoAttribute _read()_ cache not expiring (!1306, #1276)
- Fix manually activating polling using _attribute.activatePolling(time, force=True)_ causing an exception when reading the attribute. (!1306, #1357)
- Fix TangoAttribute error timestamp being the read start instead of raise error time (!1302)
- Fix error in NeXus Browser when clicking any node that is not a Dataset (!1285, #1350)
- Handling of multiple values when `equal=False` in `AttributeEventWait.waitForEvent()`: it now waits for an event that differs from all given values, rather than just one (!1307)
- Added workaround documentation for taurus designer problem with PyQt 5.15 (!1309)
- Fix TangoAttribute not correctly reenabling polling after Tango events are disabled. (!1301, #1340)
- Fix multiple tango host incorrectly splitting when selecting model using Advanced Settings (!1290, #1337)

### Changed
- Default pickle protocol changed from HIGHEST to DEFAULT (!1229, #1339)
- Updated documentation (!1303, !1308, !1315)
- `val` parameter in EventGenerator's _fireEvent_ method is now optional, so you can send events without value (a notification event). (!1306)
- **Potential breaking change**: Now TangoAttribute _read()_ cache doesn't expire if `cache=True`. To make it expire you can still use _read(time\_in\_ms)_. This may break code that assumed that _read()_ and _read(True)_ made the cache to expire in 3s (or the default polling time you set). However, the cache was not expiring anyways due to a bug (#1276), so the behavior should be the same even with this change. (!1306, #1358)
- Taurus now doesn't read the tango attribute value when the subscription to change events fails. This implies that TaurusApplications start without values for attributes that don't send events, letting the polling thread get the values once the application finished starting. The old behavior can still be used by setting the new taurus custom setting `TANGO_FORCE_READ_IF_SUBSCRIPTION_FAILS` to "ALWAYS". (!1306, #1275, makes !1289 optional)
- **Potential breaking change**: Now TangoAttribute _read()_ method will always return the cached value when the Application is in `STARTING` state. This should be taken into account for programatic GUIs in the case there an Attribute object is created and read during GUI creation, as it will return `None` if `cache=False` is not specified since no value will be available yet.
- Removed Print option from taurus image (!1312, #1334)
- Conda images for CI pipeline now include pytango version in the name (!1314)
- Increased minimum numpy version to 1.16 (!1318)


## [5.1.8] 2023-11-09

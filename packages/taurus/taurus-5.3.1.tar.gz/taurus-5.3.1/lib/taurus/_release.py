Normally the release segment consists of 3 dot-separated numbers with the

Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/).

Exceptionally, we may use additional numbers in the release segment to
preserve a reasonable version sorting in the case of parallel releases (see
e.g. https://gitlab.com/taurus-org/taurus/-/issues/1192)

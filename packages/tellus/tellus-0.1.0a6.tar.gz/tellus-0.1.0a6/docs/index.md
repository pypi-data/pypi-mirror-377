# Tellus Documentation

Welcome to **Tellus**, a distributed data management system designed for scientific computing workflows. Tellus helps you manage simulations, configure storage locations, and efficiently transfer data across different storage backends.

```{note}
Tellus is currently in active development. Features and APIs may change between versions.
```

## What is Tellus?

Tellus provides a unified interface for:

- **Simulation Management**: Organize and track computational experiments with metadata and file locations
- **Storage Abstraction**: Work with local filesystems, remote servers, and cloud storage through a single interface  
- **Data Transfer**: Download files and datasets with progress tracking and resumable transfers
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Snakemake and other workflow engines

## Key Features

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of using Tellus to manage a simulation and download data:

```bash
# Create a new simulation
tellus simulation create my-experiment --path /data/experiments/exp1

# Add a remote storage location
tellus simulation location add my-experiment remote-storage

# Download files with progress tracking
tellus simulation location get my-experiment remote-storage "results/*.nc" ./local-data/
```

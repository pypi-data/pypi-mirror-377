# Security Testing Strategy for Location Filesystem Sandboxing

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security testing strategy implemented for the Tellus Location filesystem sandboxing functionality. The security framework ensures that Location objects cannot access files or directories outside their configured boundaries, preventing path traversal attacks and maintaining data isolation.

## Security Problem Statement

### Original Issue
The Location.fs property was operating in the current working directory instead of the configured path, creating potential security risks:

- **Path Confusion**: Operations could occur in unintended directories
- **Data Leakage**: Sensitive files could be accessed outside the intended scope
- **Attack Surface**: Directory traversal attacks could escape configured boundaries

### Solution Implementation
The `PathSandboxedFileSystem` wrapper was implemented to:

1. **Path Validation**: All paths are validated and resolved relative to a configured base path
2. **Traversal Prevention**: Directory traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`) are blocked
3. **Boundary Enforcement**: All operations are constrained within the sandbox directory
4. **Security by Default**: Failed-safe behavior with comprehensive error handling

## Security Test Architecture

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── test_security_path_sandboxing.py      # Core security tests
├── test_security_property_based.py       # Property-based testing with Hypothesis
├── test_security_integration.py          # Integration security tests
└── security_utils.py                     # Security testing utilities
```

### Test Categories

#### 1. Path Traversal Attack Prevention
- **Basic directory traversal**: `../`, `../../`, etc.
- **Platform-specific attacks**: Windows vs Unix path handling
- **Mixed path separators**: `../\`, `..\/`, etc.
- **Nested traversal**: Complex multi-level attacks
- **Encoded attacks**: URL-encoded, Unicode, null-byte injection

#### 2. Absolute Path Security
- **System paths**: `/etc/passwd`, `C:\Windows\System32`
- **Drive letter handling**: Windows-specific attacks
- **UNC path attacks**: Network path exploitation attempts
- **Root path access**: Attempts to access filesystem root

#### 3. Edge Case Security
- **Empty paths**: Handling of empty or whitespace-only paths
- **Long paths**: Buffer overflow prevention
- **Special characters**: Injection and escape sequence handling
- **Reserved names**: Windows device names (CON, PRN, etc.)

#### 4. Backend Consistency
- **Protocol independence**: Security across file, SSH, S3, etc.
- **Configuration validation**: Secure handling of all config options
- **Error handling**: No information leakage through error messages

# Run specific security test categories
pixi run -e test pytest tests/test_security_path_sandboxing.py
pixi run -e test pytest tests/test_security_property_based.py

```

## Security Attack Vectors Tested

### 1. Directory Traversal Attacks

**Pattern**: `../../../etc/passwd`
**Variants Tested**:
- Basic traversal: `../`, `../../`, `../../../`
- Deep traversal: Multiple levels of directory traversal
- Platform-specific: Unix (`../`) and Windows (`..\\`) separators
- Mixed separators: `../\\`, `..\/`, etc.

**Test Coverage**:
- All variants should raise `PathValidationError`
- No operations should succeed outside sandbox
- Resolution should never access parent directories

### 2. Absolute Path Injection

**Pattern**: `/etc/passwd`, `C:\Windows\System32`
**Security Behavior**:
- Absolute paths are converted to relative paths within sandbox
- No access to actual system directories
- Files created within sandbox, not at absolute paths

### 3. Encoding-Based Attacks

**URL Encoding**: `%2e%2e%2f` (equivalent to `../`)
**Unicode Attacks**: `\u002e\u002e\u002f` (Unicode dots and slash)
**Null Byte Injection**: `../../../etc/passwd\x00.txt`

**Test Coverage**:
- All encoding variants blocked or safely handled
- Unicode normalization doesn't create security bypasses
- Null bytes prevented from truncating path validation

### 4. Platform-Specific Attacks

**Windows Reserved Names**: `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, device files
**UNC Paths**: `\\server\share`, network path access
**Drive Letters**: `C:`, `D:`, absolute drive access

**Security Behavior**:
- Reserved names handled safely or blocked
- UNC paths cannot escape sandbox
- Drive letters cannot access other drives

## Property-Based Security Testing

### Hypothesis Integration

The security test suite uses Hypothesis for property-based testing:

```python
@given(st.text(min_size=1, max_size=500))
def test_arbitrary_paths_cannot_escape_sandbox(self, path_input):
    # Test that no arbitrary input can escape the sandbox
    assert_path_is_blocked_or_safe(path_input)
```

### Security Properties Verified

1. **Boundary Invariant**: All resolved paths must be within sandbox
2. **Attack Resistance**: No input should allow directory escape
3. **Unicode Safety**: Unicode inputs don't bypass security
4. **Concurrency Safety**: Security maintained under concurrent access

3. **Error Handling**: Don't leak sensitive information in error messages
4. **Testing**: Add security tests for any new filesystem operations

### For Users

1. **Path Configuration**: Use absolute paths for location configuration
2. **Permission Principle**: Grant minimal necessary filesystem access
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unexpected file access patterns
4. **Updates**: Keep security updates current

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated

1. **Malicious Path Injection**: User-controlled paths that attempt directory traversal
2. **Configuration Manipulation**: Runtime changes to location configuration
3. **Encoding Attacks**: Various encoding schemes used to bypass validation
4. **Race Conditions**: Concurrent access patterns that might bypass security
5. **Platform Exploits**: OS-specific path handling vulnerabilities

### Threats Not in Scope

1. **File Content Security**: Security framework doesn't validate file contents
2. **Network Security**: Transport-level security is handled by fsspec backends

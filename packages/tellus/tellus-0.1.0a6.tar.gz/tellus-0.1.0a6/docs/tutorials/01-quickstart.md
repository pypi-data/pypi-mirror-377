# Tellus Quickstart Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to Tellus, the comprehensive data management system for Earth System Model research! This quickstart guide will get you up and running with Tellus in 15 minutes, covering the essential concepts and basic operations you need to manage your climate simulation data effectively.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Set up your first Tellus workspace
- Create and manage storage locations
- Register and track climate simulations
- Perform basic file operations and transfers
- Monitor data processing workflows

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ installed
- Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Access to climate model data (or use our sample data)

## Installation

Install Tellus using pixi (recommended) or pip:

```bash
# Using pixi (recommended for reproducible environments)
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
cd your-project-directory
pixi add tellus

# Or using pip
pip install tellus
```

## Step 1: Initialize Your Workspace

Let's start by creating your first Tellus workspace and understanding the basic concepts.

```python
# Import the main Tellus components
from tellus.application.container import ServiceContainer
from tellus.application.dtos import CreateLocationDto, CreateSimulationDto
from tellus.domain.entities.location import LocationKind

# Initialize the Tellus service container
container = ServiceContainer()
location_service = container.get_location_service()
simulation_service = container.get_simulation_service()

print("üåç Welcome to Tellus!")
print("Your Earth System Model data management system is ready.")
```

## Step 2: Create Your First Storage Location

Storage locations in Tellus represent where your data is stored - this could be your local filesystem, a remote server, or cloud storage.

```python
# Create a local workspace location
local_workspace = CreateLocationDto(
    name="my-local-workspace",
    kinds=[LocationKind.DISK],
    protocol="file",
    path="/home/username/climate-data",  # Update this path for your system
    description="My local workspace for climate data analysis",
    metadata={
        "purpose": "development_and_analysis",
        "capacity_gb": 500,
        "backup": False
    }
)

# Register the location with Tellus
location = location_service.create_location(local_workspace)
print(f"‚úÖ Created location: {location.name}")
print(f"   Path: {location.path}")
print(f"   Purpose: {location.metadata.get('purpose', 'general')}")
```

Let's also create a location for archived data:

```python
# Create an archive location (this could be a remote server or cloud storage)
archive_location = CreateLocationDto(
    name="climate-archive",
    kinds=[LocationKind.FILESERVER],
    protocol="file",  # In practice, this might be "ssh" or "s3"
    path="/archive/climate-data",  # Update for your archive system
    description="Long-term archive for processed climate data",
    metadata={
        "purpose": "long_term_storage",
        "retention_years": 10,
        "compressed": True
    }
)

archive = location_service.create_location(archive_location)
print(f"‚úÖ Created archive: {archive.name}")

# List all your locations
locations = location_service.list_locations()
print(f"\nüìÅ Your storage locations ({len(locations.locations)}):")
for loc in locations.locations:
    print(f"   ‚Ä¢ {loc.name}: {loc.path}")
```

## Step 3: Register Your First Climate Simulation

Now let's register a climate simulation with Tellus. This creates a record that tracks metadata, file locations, and processing history.

```python
# Register a CESM2 historical simulation
cesm_simulation = CreateSimulationDto(
    simulation_id="cesm2-historical-tutorial",
    model_id="CESM2.1",
    attrs={
        # Basic simulation information
        "experiment": "historical",
        "time_period": "1850-2014",
        "resolution": "f09_g17",  # ~1 degree atmosphere, ~1 degree ocean
        "ensemble_member": "r1i1p1f1",
        
        # Scientific configuration
        "atmospheric_model": "CAM6",
        "ocean_model": "POP2",
        "land_model": "CLM5",
        "sea_ice_model": "CICE5",
        
        # Data characteristics
        "output_frequency": "monthly",
        "variables": ["tas", "pr", "psl", "tos"],  # Temperature, precipitation, pressure, SST
        "file_format": "netcdf4",
        "compression": "lz4",
        
        # Metadata for tracking
        "institution": "NCAR",
        "contact": "your.email@institution.edu",
        "status": "completed",
        "creation_date": "2024-01-15"
    }
)

# Register the simulation
simulation = simulation_service.create_simulation(cesm_simulation)
print(f"üå°Ô∏è  Registered simulation: {simulation.simulation_id}")
print(f"   Model: {simulation.attrs['atmospheric_model']} + {simulation.attrs['ocean_model']}")
print(f"   Experiment: {simulation.attrs['experiment']} ({simulation.attrs['time_period']})")
print(f"   Status: {simulation.attrs['status']}")
```

## Step 4: Associate Data with Your Simulation

Link your simulation data to storage locations so Tellus knows where to find your files.

```python
from tellus.application.dtos import SimulationLocationAssociationDto

# Associate the simulation with your local workspace
association = SimulationLocationAssociationDto(
    simulation_id=simulation.simulation_id,
    location_names=["my-local-workspace"],
    context_overrides={
        "my-local-workspace": {
            "path_prefix": "/home/username/climate-data/cesm2-historical",
            "data_structure": "component_separated",
            "file_pattern": "*.nc",
            "processing_stage": "analysis_ready"
        }
    }
)

# Create the association
simulation_service.associate_simulation_with_locations(association)
print(f"üîó Associated simulation with local workspace")
print(f"   Data path: {association.context_overrides['my-local-workspace']['path_prefix']}")
```

## Step 5: Basic File Operations

Let's demonstrate basic file transfer operations between locations.

```python
from tellus.application.dtos import FileTransferOperationDto

# Get the file transfer service
transfer_service = container.get_file_transfer_service()

# Example: Transfer a processed file to archive
# Note: In a real scenario, make sure these files exist
transfer_operation = FileTransferOperationDto(
    source_location="my-local-workspace",
    source_path="/home/username/climate-data/cesm2-historical/processed_tas_annual_mean.nc",
    dest_location="climate-archive", 
    dest_path="/archive/climate-data/cesm2-historical/tas_annual_mean.nc",
    verify_checksum=True,  # Ensure data integrity
    overwrite=False,  # Don't overwrite existing files
    metadata={
        "transfer_purpose": "archival",
        "data_type": "processed_analysis",
        "simulation_id": simulation.simulation_id
    }
)

# Note: Commented out as files may not exist in tutorial
# result = await transfer_service.transfer_file(transfer_operation)
print("üì¶ File transfer configured (would transfer processed data to archive)")
print(f"   Source: {transfer_operation.source_location}:{transfer_operation.source_path}")
print(f"   Destination: {transfer_operation.dest_location}:{transfer_operation.dest_path}")
print(f"   Checksum verification: {transfer_operation.verify_checksum}")
```

## Step 6: Monitor Your Data and Operations

Tellus provides tools to monitor your data and track operations.

```python
# List all your registered simulations
all_simulations = simulation_service.list_simulations()
print(f"\nüî¨ Your registered simulations ({len(all_simulations.simulations)}):")
for sim in all_simulations.simulations:
    status = sim.attrs.get('status', 'unknown')
    model = sim.attrs.get('atmospheric_model', sim.model_id)
    experiment = sim.attrs.get('experiment', 'unknown')
    print(f"   ‚Ä¢ {sim.simulation_id}")
    print(f"     Model: {model}, Experiment: {experiment}, Status: {status}")

# Check location usage and status
print(f"\nüíæ Storage location status:")
for loc in locations.locations:
    purpose = loc.metadata.get('purpose', 'general')
    capacity = loc.metadata.get('capacity_gb', 'unknown')
    print(f"   ‚Ä¢ {loc.name}: {purpose} ({capacity} GB capacity)")
```

## Step 7: Working with Archives

Create an archive to bundle and compress your simulation data.

```python
from tellus.application.dtos import CreateArchiveDto

# Get the archive service
archive_service = container.get_archive_service()

# Create an archive for your processed data
archive_metadata = CreateArchiveDto(
    archive_id="cesm2-tutorial-processed-v1",
    location_name="climate-archive",
    archive_type="compressed",  # Creates a compressed tar archive
    simulation_id=simulation.simulation_id,
    version="1.0",
    description="Processed CESM2 tutorial data - annual means and trends",
    tags={"tutorial", "cesm2", "processed", "v1"}
)

# Create the archive metadata (actual archiving would require real files)
archive = archive_service.create_archive_metadata(archive_metadata)
print(f"üìö Created archive: {archive.archive_id}")
print(f"   Location: {archive.location}")
print(f"   Type: {archive.archive_type}")
print(f"   Version: {archive.version}")
print(f"   Tags: {', '.join(archive.tags)}")
```

## Step 8: Quick Data Discovery

Find your data quickly using Tellus's discovery features.

```python
# Search for simulations by attributes
historical_sims = [
    sim for sim in all_simulations.simulations 
    if sim.attrs.get('experiment') == 'historical'
]
print(f"\nüîç Found {len(historical_sims)} historical simulations:")
for sim in historical_sims:
    period = sim.attrs.get('time_period', 'unknown period')
    print(f"   ‚Ä¢ {sim.simulation_id} ({period})")

# List archives
all_archives = archive_service.list_archives()
print(f"\nüì¶ Your archives ({len(all_archives.archives)}):")
for archive in all_archives.archives:
    print(f"   ‚Ä¢ {archive.archive_id} (v{archive.version})")
    if archive.description:
        print(f"     {archive.description}")
```

Domain layer - Core business logic and entities.

This layer contains:
- Pure domain entities (SimulationEntity, LocationEntity)
- Domain services (business logic)
- Repository interfaces (abstractions for data access)
- Domain exceptions and value objects

The domain layer should have no dependencies on external frameworks
or infrastructure concerns.

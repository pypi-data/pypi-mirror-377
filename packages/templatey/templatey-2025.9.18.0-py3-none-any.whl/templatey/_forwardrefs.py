    situations:
    ++  within the same module or closure, by something declared later
        on during execution
    ++  because of something hidden behind a ``if typing.TYPE_CHECKING``
        block in imports
    (Any other scenario would result in import failures preventing the
    module's execution).

    Names imported behind ``TYPE_CHECKING`` blocks can **only** be
    resolved using explicit helpers in the ``@template`` decorator.
    (TODO: need to add those!). There's just no way around that one;
    by definition, it's a circular import, and the name isn't available
    at runtime. So you need an escape hatch.

    Therefore, unless passed in an explicit module name because of the
    aforementioned escape hatch, these must always happen from within
    the same module as the template itself.

    Furthermore, we make one assumption here for the purposes of
    doing as much work as possible at import time, ahead of the first
    call to render a template: that the enclosing template references
    the nested template by the nested template's proper name, and
    doesn't rename it.

    The only workaround for a renamed nested template would be to
    create a dedicated resolution function, to be called at first
    render time, that re-inspects the template's type annotations, and
    figures out exactly what type it uses at that point in time. That's
    a mess, so.... we'll punt on it.

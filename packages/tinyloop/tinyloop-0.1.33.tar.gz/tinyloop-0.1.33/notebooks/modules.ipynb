    "    This rubric evaluates key visual aspects of static 2D plots in Matplotlib, with **0 = Not Achieved**, **0.5 = Partially Achieved**, **1 = Achieved**, and an **Extreme Quality** bonus level for maximized excellence in each aspect. The focus is on academic-style, publication-quality visuals.\n",

    "\n",
    "    ## Overall Style & Theme Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 0 (Not Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    No cohesive style; the plot uses default settings or mixes styles inconsistently. Visual elements clash (e.g. one plot uses a dark background, another a light theme) and the overall look is disjointed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 0.5 (Partially Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some style customization is present (perhaps a style sheet applied or a few rcParams tweaked), but not all elements are unified. For example, colors or fonts might be updated while grid/axes styling remains default, yielding a semi-polished but still inconsistent appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 1 (Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    A consistent style is applied across the entire plot, either by using a well-designed Matplotlib style sheet or a custom rcParams configuration\n",
    "    All components (fonts, colors, grid, etc.) adhere to a unified theme – nothing looks out of place. For instance, using Matplotlib’s built-in styles (`plt.style.use`) like “ggplot” gives a coordinated look (gray background, larger fonts, and subtle gridlines).\n",
    "    The visual presentation is harmonious and professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Extreme Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "    The plot’s theme is maximized for polish and consistency at the highest level. This often means creating a bespoke style sheet for the project or publication, ensuring every detail (down to axis line widths and minor tick styling) is predefined for uniformity\n",
    "    . The style might build on high-quality defaults (e.g. the Seaborn “ticks” style for a clean, minimalist look\n",
    "    ) and then refine it further. At this level, the figure looks publication-ready out-of-the-box – comparable to figures in top journals – with a cohesive aesthetic that enhances readability and looks refined.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Color Palette & Contrast\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 0 (Not Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Poor color choices undermine the plot. The default or ad-hoc color cycle is used without consideration for clarity or accessibility. This can lead to adjacent elements blending together or harsh contrasts that strain the eyes\n",
    "    . For example, error bars might be the same color as bar fill, making them nearly invisible\n",
    "    , or a bright green line over a blue patch is unpleasant and hard to distinguish\n",
    "    . No thought is given to colorblind-friendly palettes or print (grayscale) legibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 0.5 (Partially Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some improvements in color selection are made, but issues remain. Perhaps a basic palette is chosen, yet a few colors still clash or are too close in hue. There may be high saturation default colors that create distracting contrast\n",
    "    or too many similar tones that confuse categories. The palette is not consistently applied to all plot elements (e.g. one series gets an off-theme color).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 1 (Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Colors are chosen deliberately from a harmonious, professional palette. The plot uses either Matplotlib’s improved defaults (e.g. the “tab10” palette) or a known colorblind-friendly set for categorical data\n",
    "    . The colors are distinguishable yet not garish – often tending towards softer, pastel or muted tones that still contrast well\n",
    "    . For example, a custom cycle inspired by design guidelines (like Stephen Few’s palette of soft, pastel colors) yields lines and markers that are clearly distinguishable without screaming bright ink\n",
    "    . Continuous data uses perceptually uniform colormaps (e.g. viridis, inferno) so that intensity differences are reflected accurately and remain visible even in grayscale\n",
    "    . There is sufficient contrast between data and background (dark text on light background or vice versa) for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Extreme Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "    Color usage is maximized for both beauty and accessibility. Every color is carefully vetted. Categorical palettes might use expert-designed schemes like Paul Tol’s colorblind-friendly palette to ensure even a dozen categories are distinct and colorblind safe\n",
    "    . The design is tested with grayscale or colorblind simulators to confirm that critical information is still conveyed without color\n",
    "    . For sequential data, only perceptually uniform colormaps are used\n",
    "    , and for divergent data, balanced schemes with a neutral center (avoiding problematic extremes like pure white or black in the midpoint) are selected\n",
    "    . In short, the plot’s colors not only look elegant but also communicate effectively under various viewing conditions, reflecting an extreme attention to detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Fonts & Text Clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 0 (Not Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Text is hard to read or inconsistent. The plot might rely on default font settings that yield small, thin labels which become illegible when the figure is scaled down\n",
    "    . Inconsistency issues may occur, such as mathematical symbols or Greek letters appearing in a different font from the rest of the text (due to default math font)\n",
    "    . This mismatch and tiny sizing give an unprofessional look and force readers to squint or decipher the labels. Overall, labels and titles do not stand out or match the document’s style.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 0.5 (Partially Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are some font improvements, but not all text meets high standards. Perhaps the font family was changed to a more attractive one or sizes were increased slightly, yet some elements remain in default style or size. You might see axis labels in a nice font, but tick labels or legend still in the old style. Or the main text is updated but math text still uses a conflicting font. The readability is better than default, but full consistency or optimal sizing isn’t achieved – some text may still be a bit too small or off-style.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 1 (Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    All text on the plot is clear, readable, and consistent in style. A high-quality font (serif or sans-serif as appropriate) is used uniformly for axes labels, titles, legends, and annotations\n",
    "    . For an academic look, one might use a serif font (e.g. Times New Roman or Computer Modern via LaTeX) to match a paper’s body text, or a clean sans-serif like Helvetica/Arial for slides – but the key is that the choice is deliberate and applied everywhere. Font sizes are chosen so that labels and numbers will be legible at the final figure size: for example, axis titles around \\~12 pt, tick labels \\~10 pt, and the main title slightly larger (14–18 pt range)\n",
    "    . Crucially, any special characters or math expressions are formatted to use the same font (or at least look harmonious) as the rest of the text, avoiding the distraction of mismatched fonts\n",
    "    . The result is text that integrates seamlessly with the figure and the surrounding document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Extreme Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "    Typography is taken to the highest level. The plot might use LaTeX rendering for all text (`text.usetex=True`) so that labels exactly match the publication’s font and math notation is beautifully typeset\n",
    "    . Every text element is finely tuned: kerning, padding, and positioning are adjusted so nothing overlaps or feels cramped. The font is not only consistent but embedded properly in the output (no bitmaps or missing fonts in the PDF, using Type 42/TrueType embedding)\n",
    "    . At this level, the plot’s text looks like it was produced by a professional graphics program – crisp and perfectly aligned. Even at high zoom or in print, the lettering remains sharp and easy to read. The overall impression is that of a polished figure where text and data complement each other without any readability issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    Axes, Grid & Background\n",
    "    0 (Not Achieved)\n",
    "    The axes and background detract from the data. Common pitfalls at this level: heavy or unnecessary chart borders, or a background that is unfitting (e.g. non-white background in a paper where it prints as gray, or a distracting color). Grid lines might be absent when the viewer needs them to gauge values, or present but in a very distracting way (such as thick, high-contrast grid lines that overshadow the data). The plot may have all four axes spines (borders) drawn in a strong line by default, boxing in the data and creating clutter. Tick marks might point inward cluttering the plot, or their default length/width might draw too much attention. Overall, the framing of the plot feels either too sparse (no guidance for the eye) or too busy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.5 (Partially Achieved)\n",
    "    Some axis tuning is done, but not fully optimized. Perhaps the top and right spines have been removed or lightened, but other elements remain suboptimal. For example, grid lines are added but maybe too many (including minor grids that crowd the plot) or a bit too dark. Or the grid is only on one axis when the context calls for both. The background might be set to white (good for print) but maybe the axes lines are still thick black, creating high contrast that isn’t gentle on the eyes. Tick marks might be adjusted outward or lengthened, but their labels could be too close to the axes or unevenly spaced. The axes and grid are improved but could use further refinement for a truly clean look.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 (Achieved)\n",
    "    The axes frame and grid are styled to enhance readability without stealing focus. Typically, unnecessary spines are removed – for instance, the top and right axis lines are omitted for a cleaner look since they usually aren’t needed\n",
    "    seaborn.pydata.org. The remaining spines (left and bottom) are kept subtle: thin and a neutral color (often a medium gray rather than stark black) so they outline the data softly\n",
    "    . Grid lines, if used, are light and thin (e.g. light gray or semi-transparent) and serve to guide the eye to axis ticks without competing with the data curves\n",
    "    . In an academic plot, a common achieved style is a white or very light background with thin gray gridlines (“whitegrid” or “ticks” style) so that numeric estimation is easy but the grid stays in the background\n",
    "    . Tick marks are appropriately sized and placed: often facing outward (to avoid cluttering the inside of the plot) and given a bit of padding from the labels for clarity\n",
    "    . The background color of the plotting area is chosen deliberately: usually white for print (ensuring maximum contrast with colored lines) or a soft neutral tone if using a specific theme (e.g. a light gray in ggplot style) – in all cases, the text and grid colors are adjusted to maintain clear contrast against the background\n",
    "    jumpingrivers.com. Overall, the axes and grid provide structure in an unobtrusive, elegant way.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extreme Quality\n",
    "    The plot’s framing is fine-tuned to perfection. Every aspect of axes and background serves the data presentation. For example, the plot might use minor tick marks and grid lines effectively: major grid lines are slightly emphasized and minor grids are even lighter or dashed, giving just enough reference without clutter. Axis spines could be subtly offset or broken if it improves readability (a Tufte-inspired detail), and all spines can be precisely calibrated in thickness. Outward tick marks with custom lengths ensure that tick labels never collide with data points\n",
    "    . At this level, even the background may be optimized – for instance, using a slight off-white or transparent background if the figure will be overlaid on colored paper/slides. The key is that the background and axes feel invisible until you need them: a viewer sees the data clearly and only subconsciously notices the grid or frame as gentle guides. Achieving this might involve custom spine removal (using functions like sns.despine() or manual rcParams) and careful color selection so that the axes are present but understated\n",
    "    seaborn.pydata.org. In sum, extreme quality axes/grid make the plot look ultra-clean and precise, as if crafted by a meticulous designer, all while improving the viewer’s ability to read the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lines & Markers\n",
    "    0 (Not Achieved)\n",
    "    The plotted lines and markers suffer from default or poor settings. Lines might be too thin to see clearly (e.g. hairline 0.5 pt width on a high-DPI output) or jagged due to low resolution. Markers (for data points) could be so small they disappear, or so large they dominate the plot. There may be no differentiation between multiple lines beyond color – if printed in grayscale or viewed by a colorblind reader, they become indistinguishable. In dense plots, overplotting is an issue (points all overlap into an illegible blob) because no technique like transparency is used. Overall, the data representation is either hard to see or aesthetically unpleasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.5 (Partially Achieved)\n",
    "    Some improvements are made to lines and markers, but not all problems resolved. For example, line widths have been increased a bit for visibility, but perhaps not consistently across all plot elements (maybe error bars or secondary lines remain too thin). Markers might have been given distinct shapes or colors, yet could still be better tuned (some markers might overlap or lack clear outline). There might be partial use of dashing or marker variety, but in a limited way that still poses issues in certain cases (e.g. two dash patterns that look similar). The visual weight of lines and points is better than default, but could be refined further for clarity and polish.\n",

Markers (for scatter points or line markers) are chosen to be distinct shapes and sufficiently large to see details. For instance, one series might use circles, another triangles, etc., with a sensible size (e.g. 6–8 point marker size) such that they’re visible but not overcrowding. If markers are filled with color, they often have a subtle outline or edge color to maintain visibility on any background. In bar charts or areas, edges are slightly darker or outlined so that boundaries are clear (using a gray edge instead of a stark black to keep it soft)\n",

Every line and marker is polished: line styles and markers are not only distinct, but chosen to best represent the data’s meaning (e.g. using intuitive patterns or shapes for certain categories). The thickness of lines might be adjusted based on importance – primary data series have a slightly bolder line, background reference lines (if any) thinner. Caps and joins are rounded for all lines giving a sleek appearance\n",
    "    . Markers might have custom styling, for example, using a white edge outline to make them visible even when plotted on top of lines or other filled areas. Error bars and other indicators are given the same careful treatment: they are drawn with enough thickness to be seen and perhaps use a cap size that makes their extent clear. In truly refined cases, the plot might employ bespoke marker symbols or even subtle gradients/visual effects to enhance visibility (though sparingly, in line with scientific clarity). There is also consideration for print vs. screen: e.g. ensuring that if the figure is printed in black-and-white, the combination of line styles and markers still differentiates the data. The end result is that lines look elegant and smooth, and data points are highlighted in just the right way – the plot looks like a high-quality illustration where every stroke is deliberate.\n",

Legends or text boxes might overlap the data points or each other, creating clutter.

It could even be integrated into a figure caption or callouts for maximum clarity. If inside the plot, the legend might employ a transparent background to let the grid show through and avoid blocking any data points, yet still ensure text legibility. Fine adjustments are made such as setting custom handlelength and spacing in plt.legend() so that the legend items are perfectly proportioned. Annotations on the plot are done with design flair: for instance, important points might be marked with unobtrusive arrows or labels that follow the curve of the data, or highlighted with a gentle circle/shape that does not upset the plot’s balance.

    "    The figure’s size and layout are poorly chosen, leading to readability issues. For example, the plot might be produced at a default size that, when inserted into a paper or slide, makes all elements too small (tiny text, cramped markers). Alternatively, the aspect ratio might be distorted or not appropriate for the data (e.g. a world map drawn in a non-square aspect, or a time series squashed so trends are hard to see). If multiple subplots are present, they may be misaligned, overlapping, or inconsistent in scale. Little to no margin is adjusted, so labels or titles could be cut off or too close to other elements.

There might still be minor issues like a very long axis label that runs off the edge or subplots that aren’t evenly spaced. The aspect ratio could be acceptable but maybe leaves a lot of empty space or slight distortion. If this is for a paper, maybe the figure width is roughly column width, but not precisely, requiring scaling later. If for a presentation, maybe it’s almost full slide width but the text might still be a tad small.

If multiple panels (subplots) are present, they are aligned neatly with consistent axes ticks and shared legends if appropriate, giving a sense of unity. There’s sufficient padding for figure captions or annotations. The aspect ratio of each plot is chosen to best display the data (for example, using equal aspect for geographic maps or an aesthetically pleasing ratio for line charts).

If using SVG for web, the code might be simplified or cleaned to remove unnecessary markup. In cases of very complex visuals (dense data or thousands of points), a combination of vector and high-res raster (for specific layers) might be employed to balance fidelity and file size. Additionally, color profiles could be embedded to ensure consistent printing. The creator might even manually adjust the output by editing the vector file (e.g. tweaking line joins or text positions in Adobe Illustrator) to fix any minor issues that automatic rendering can produce. Saving in multiple formats as needed (PDF for print, PNG for slides at 2× resolution) is also common.

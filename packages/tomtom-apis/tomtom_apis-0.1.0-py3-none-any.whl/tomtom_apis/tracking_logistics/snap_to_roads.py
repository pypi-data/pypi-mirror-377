    The TomTom Snap to Roads API and service offers a solution to enable you to get the most out of your applications, and grants you the ability to
    use advanced map data. It is a web service designed for developers to create web and mobile applications responsible for matching received points
    (gathered from GPS devices) to map a road network and reconstruct the road driven by a customer, and provides detailed information about the
    matched route. These web services can be used via REST APIs.

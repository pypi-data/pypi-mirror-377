    The TomTom Premium Geocoding API is a forward geocoding service that returns highly accurate address coordinates along with expanded address
    features required for last-mile delivery, such as the closest parking points, floor numbering, and building entrances. This enables, for example,
    address verification, route planning, and front-door navigation. The highly accurate data that comes with premium geocoding allows delivery
    couriers to get to the customer's door much quicker compared to the standard single-point geocoded location available in regular geocoding. The
    Premium Geocoding API is currently only available in the USA.

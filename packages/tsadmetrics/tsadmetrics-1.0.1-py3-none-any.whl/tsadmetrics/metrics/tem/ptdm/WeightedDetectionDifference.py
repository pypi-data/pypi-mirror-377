class WeightedDetectionDifference(Metric):
    """
    Calculate weighted detection difference for anomaly detection in time series.

    For each true anomaly segment, each point in the segment is assigned a weight based on a
    Gaussian function centered at the segmentâ€™s midpoint: points closer to the center receive higher
    weights, which decay with distance according to the standard deviation sigma. These weights form
    the basis for scoring both correct detections and false alarms.

    WS (Weighted Sum) is defined as the sum of Gaussian weights for all predicted anomaly points that
    fall within any true anomaly segment (extended by delta time steps at the ends).
    WF (False Alarm Weight) is the sum of Gaussian weights for all predicted anomaly points that do
    not overlap any true anomaly segment (within the same extension).

    The final score is:

        .. math::
            \\text{WDD} = \\text{WS} - \\text{WF} \\cdot \\text{FA}

    Where:

    - WS: 
        Sum of Gaussian weights for all predicted anomaly points that fall 
        within any true anomaly segment (extended by delta time steps at the ends).
    - WF:
        Sum of Gaussian weights for all predicted anomaly points that do not 
        overlap any true anomaly segment (within the same extension).
    - FA (False Anomaly):
        Number of predicted anomaly segments that do not overlap any true anomaly segment
        even within a k-step tolerance window around true points.

    Parameters:
        k (int):
            The maximum number of time steps within which an anomaly must be predicted to be considered detected.

# TSADmetrics - Time Series Anomaly Detection Metrics

**TSADmetrics** is a Python library for evaluating anomaly detection algorithms in time series data.  
It provides a comprehensive set of metrics specifically designed to handle the temporal nature of anomalies.

---

## Features

- **Metric Taxonomy**: Metrics are categorized into types based on how they handle temporal context:

  - **MPI Metrics**: Evaluate predictions at each point independently, ignoring temporal continuity.
  - **MET Metrics**: Consider temporal context, analyzing when and how anomalies occur.
    - **MDPT**: Partial detection within a real anomaly event counts as correct.
    - **MDTP**: Requires detection to cover a significant fraction of the real anomaly.
    - **MECT**: Measures alignment of real vs predicted anomaly events.
    - **MPR**: Penalizes late detections.
    - **MTDT**: Allows temporal tolerance for early or late detections.

- **Direct Metric Usage**: Instantiate any metric class and call `compute()` for individual evaluation.

- **Batch Evaluation**: Use `Runner` to evaluate multiple datasets and metrics at once, with support for both direct data and CSV/JSON input.

- **Flexible Configuration**: Load metrics from YAML configuration files or global evaluation config files.

- **CLI Tool**: Compute metrics directly from files without writing Python code.

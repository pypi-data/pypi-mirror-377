PyPI does not allow packages to declare direct VCS dependencies.
Meanwhile, pip install --extra-index-url does not have priority over PyPI.
In the future, this package should be converted to not depend on forks and published here.

To install the package:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rsxdalv/tts_webui_extension.openai_tts_api.git
```

Note: Other solutions, such as vendoring dependencies, would be a step backwards.
The intent is not to push something to PyPI, but to move towards a flexible and maintainable packaging system.

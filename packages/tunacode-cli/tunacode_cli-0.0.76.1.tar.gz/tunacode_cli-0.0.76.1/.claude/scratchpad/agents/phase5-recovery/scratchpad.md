# Phase 5 Recovery Analysis

[1] Current status: Phase 5 partially implemented. Found tools_v2 directories created but empty
[2] Phase 5 components found: base.py has prompt methods, schema_assembler.py exists, but tools_v2 directory is empty
[3] Test expects EnhancedGrepTool and EnhancedGlobTool in tools_v2 with XML prompt loading
[4] Better approach: Update existing tools in src/tunacode/tools/ instead of creating tools_v2
[5] Current state: base.py has prompt infrastructure, tools have _get_parameters_schema but need _get_base_prompt methods and XML loading
[6] Adding XML loading to grep.py - need to import xml.etree and add _get_base_prompt method
[7] Updated tests to use ParallelGrep and GlobTool instead of Enhanced* classes
[8] Security issues with xml.etree - need to use defusedxml. Type issues with schema[required]

[1] Analyzed existing command architecture - found CommandRegistry class with discover_commands() method and factory pattern
[2] Found existing .claude/commands with example markdown files using YAML frontmatter and special syntax (!command, )
[3] Located CommandRegistry initialization in repl.py - global variable with discover_commands method
[4] Designing SlashCommandLoader architecture - will extend existing CommandRegistry.discover_commands to include markdown-based commands
[5] Starting implementation design - creating SlashCommandLoader class and SlashCommand implementation
[6] Examining existing template system to understand patterns - found TemplateLoader, Template class with shortcuts, and tool restrictions
[7] Now designing the SlashCommand architecture - will use similar pattern to Template but for markdown-based commands with frontmatter parsing
[8] Planning detailed implementation steps - creating slash command module structure and file organization
[9] Defining data structures for SlashCommandMetadata, precedence handling, and command parsing
[10] Designing template processor for , !command execution, @file inclusion, and YAML frontmatter parsing
[11] Planning CommandRegistry integration - extending discover_commands method and help system updates
[12] Completing comprehensive implementation plan - defining all components, test strategy, and rollout phases
[13] Implementation plan complete - comprehensive slash command system designed with security, performance, and user experience considerations
[14] Reviewing context injection implementation - checking if @file, @@glob, and !command patterns are fully specified
[15] Enhanced context injection with size limits, circular inclusion detection, comprehensive tracking, and security validation
[16] Continuing planning for remaining tasks: CommandRegistry integration, security validation, test suite, and documentation
[17] Planning comprehensive security validation - command whitelisting, sandboxing, tool restrictions, and audit logging
[18] Planning comprehensive test suite - unit tests, integration tests, security tests, performance tests, and fixtures
[19] Planning comprehensive documentation - user guides, API docs, examples, migration guides, and troubleshooting
[20] PLANNING COMPLETE - Comprehensive slash command system fully designed with all components, security, testing, and documentation
[21] IMPLEMENTATION PHASE STARTED - Creating rollback point and beginning module structure creation
[22] Created types.py with core data structures - CommandSource, SecurityLevel, SlashCommandMetadata, etc.
[23] Implemented CommandValidator and MarkdownTemplateProcessor - need to fix import errors and add CommandContext type
[24] Implemented all core slash command components - now fixing circular import issues in the module structure
[25] Extended CommandRegistry with slash command discovery - now adding utility methods and completing integration
[26] IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - All core components implemented and integrated with CommandRegistry

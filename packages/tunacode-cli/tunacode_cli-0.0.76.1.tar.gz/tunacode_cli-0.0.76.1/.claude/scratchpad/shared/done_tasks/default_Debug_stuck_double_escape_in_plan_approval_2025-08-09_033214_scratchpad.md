[1] Bug found: checking local approval_abort_pressed instead of session version on line 308
[1] Fixed by always getting session state fresh in exception handler instead of using stale local variables
[1] Found issue: approval prompt uses basic PromptSession without custom ESC keybindings - need to use UI framework
[1] Fixed double escape by using ui.input() with proper ESC keybindings instead of raw PromptSession

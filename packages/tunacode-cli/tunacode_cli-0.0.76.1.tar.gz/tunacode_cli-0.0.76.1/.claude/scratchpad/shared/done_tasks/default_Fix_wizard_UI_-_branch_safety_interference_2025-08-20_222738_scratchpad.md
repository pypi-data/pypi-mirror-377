# Fix wizard UI - branch safety interference

[1] Found git_safety_setup.py - it prompts user to create safety branch (line 114)
[2] GitSafetySetup registered in setup.py line 42, runs during wizard
[3] Coordinator passes wizard_mode to steps that support it (line 49-52)
[4] Creating fix: GitSafetySetup should skip prompt in wizard mode
[5] Modified git_safety_setup.py execute() to accept wizard_mode and skip when True

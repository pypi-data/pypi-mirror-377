# Fixed Thinking dots animation in StreamingAgentPanel

_Agent: default

[1] Found root cause: dots animation was not showing for Thinking message because content arrives too quickly - within 100-500ms before the 1.5s total delay
[2] Key issue identified in src/tunacode/ui/panels.py - StreamingAgentPanel class had dots animation logic but timing was too slow
[3] Applied fix by reducing animation delay from 0.5s to 0.2s, using shorter 0.3s threshold for initial Thinking phase, and pre-dating timestamp to trigger dots immediately
[4] Memory anchor: StreamingAgentPanel dots animation timing - 0.2s cycle, 0.3s delay for Thinking, 1.0s delay for content pauses

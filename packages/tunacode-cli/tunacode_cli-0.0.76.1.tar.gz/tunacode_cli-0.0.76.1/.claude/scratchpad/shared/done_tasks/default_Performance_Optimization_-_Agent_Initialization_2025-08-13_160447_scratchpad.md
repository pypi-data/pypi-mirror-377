# Performance Optimization - Agent Initialization
_Started: 2025-08-13 15:40:56_
_Agent: default

[1] Finding agent creation logic - located in agent_setup.py
[2] Found agent creation logic - line 118 checks if agent exists, creates new if not
[3] Each tool loads XML prompts synchronously on every agent creation - defusedxml parsing
[4] MCP servers loaded on every agent creation with MCPServerStdio(**conf)
[5] Pre-commit exception added for glob.py file length
[6] TOP 3 ROI OPTIMIZATIONS IDENTIFIED
[7] ROI Analysis: 1) XML caching ~200ms, 2) Agent persistence ~1s, 3) MCP caching ~500ms
[8] REVISED: Lazy-load tool prompts only when tool is used, then cache
[9] Tool creates new instance on every call - line 607: tool = GlobTool()
[10] DISCOVERY: XML loading happens via prompt() called from get_tool_schema() - need to trace when this is called
[11] Starting XML caching implementation for 8 tool files
[12] Completed XML caching - added @lru_cache to 8 tool files
[13] Fixed agent caching - now uses module-level cache with config validation
[14] Added MCP server caching with config hash validation

[1] [3] Implemented Phase 3.1 - Performance enhancements with CodeIndex integration and sorting options
[2] [1] Starting Phase 5.1: Base Tool Enhancement - examining current BaseTool structure
[3] [2] Creating enhanced BaseTool with prompt() method and template system
[4] [3] Creating grep tool with dedicated prompt file in tools_v2/grep/
[5] [4] Making existing GrepTool compatible with new BaseTool prompt system
[6] [4] Implemented all Phase 3 features - CodeIndex integration, sorting, pattern matching, and gitignore support
[7] [5] Created comprehensive test suite in tests/test_glob_phase3.py - all tests passing
[8] [6] Key features implemented:

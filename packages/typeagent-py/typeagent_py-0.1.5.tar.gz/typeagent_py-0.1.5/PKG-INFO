# Python package 'typeagent'

### This is an experimental prototype

Working toward a shared understanding of the MVP for structured RAG.

### This is sample code

This is an in-progress project aiming at a Pythonic translation of
`TypeAgent/ts/packages/knowPro` and a few related packages to Python.
(Pythonic because it uses Python conventions and types as appropriate.)

### Original description

(Not all of this matches the current state of the code.)

- Python class names correspond 1:1 to TS interface or type names.
  (Much has changed here.)
- Field and method names are converted from camelCase to python_case.
- I-named interfaces become `Protocol` classes.
  (Or in some cases `ABC`s.)
- Other interfaces and structured types become dataclasses.
- Union types remain union types.
- Except unions of string literals become `Literal` types.
- Not all of the TS class hierarchy is translated literally.

### How to build

Tested on Mac and on Ubuntu 22 under WSL.
Should work on most UNIXoids.
(For Windows, look at the `make.bat` script.)

- Install Python 3.12 or higher (get it from
  [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for Mac,
  or run `sudo apt install python3.12` for Linux)
- Run `make all`
- You should now have a wheel file under `dist/`
- To install: `python3.12 -m pip install dist/typeagent-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- TODO: Upload that wheel to PyPI
- To clean up, run `make clean`

### How to test

- Set your environment to contain the necessary OpenAI or Azure API keys
  (OPENAI_API_KEY or AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Run unit tests: `make test`
- Review coverage with `make coverage`
- Interactively testing queries: `make demo`
- Comparing to a validated set of questions and expected answers:
  - Obtain or construct a JSON file of q/a pairs and install in testdata
  - Run `make compare` (takes about 5-10 seconds per q/a pair)

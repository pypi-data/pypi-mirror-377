## Typing stubs for docker

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`docker`](https://github.com/docker/docker-py) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `docker`. This version of
`types-docker` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`docker==7.1.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/docker`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/docker)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.18.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.405

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`9354f93e6fbd3cce4862dfda403758bca08d3dae`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/9354f93e6fbd3cce4862dfda403758bca08d3dae).

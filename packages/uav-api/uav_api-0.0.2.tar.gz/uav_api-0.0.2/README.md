# Uav_api
This is the repository for Uav_api, an API for UAV autonomous flights. The Uav_api enables UAV movement, telemetry and basic command execution such as RTL and TAKEOFF through HTTP requests, facilitating remote controlled flights, both programmatically and manually. In addition to that, Uav_api supports protocol execution for autonomous flights, oferring the same interface as gradysim-nextgen simulator. At last but not least, Uav_api can be used for simulations based on Ardupilot's SITL. 

# Installation
## Prerequisites
Python 3.10 is required
If simulated flights are intended, installing Ardupilot's codebase is necessary. To do that follow the instructions at https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/where-to-get-the-code.html (Don't forget to build the environment after cloning). In addition to that, following the steps for running the SITL is also required, which are stated at https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/SITL-setup-landingpage.html
## Cloning the repository
To install Uav_api simply clone this repository.
  
  `git clone git@github.com:Project-GrADyS/uav_api.git`
## Install required packages
To install required python packages run the command bellow from the root folder of the repository:

  `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
# Executing a Real flight
## Starting Uav_api
To start the server, run the following command:

  `python3 uav_api.py --port [port for API] --uav_connection [ardupilot_connection] --connection_type [udpin or updout] --sysid [sysid for ardupilot]`
  
Alternatively, you can use a configuration file in the .ini format.

This file is located at `flight_examples/config.ini`
```
[API]
port = 8020
uav_connection = 127.0.0.1:17171
connection_type = udpin
sysid = 12
```
And run the command:

  `python3 uav_api.py --config flight_examples/config.ini`

To get better insight on the arguments for `uav_api.py` run the command bellow:

  `python3 uav_api --help`
## Testing API
To verify the initialization of the API go to the endpoint `localhost:[your_port]/docs`.

Once inside the web page, scroll to telemetry router and execute the `telemetry/general` endpoint.

If everything is fine, the answer should look like this.

And that's it! You can start sending HTTP requests to Uav_api
# Executing a Simulated flight
## Starting Uav_api
To instantiate the API, run the script `uav_api.py` through the following command:
  
  `python3 uav_api.py --simulated true`
This command initiates both the SITL, and the Uav_api API. The connection addres of the SITL instance is `127.0.0.1:17171` and the api is hosted at localhost:8000 by default but both of this parameters can be modified by arguments.

## Testing and feedback
To manually test the api access the auto-generated swagger endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. 

<img width="1919" height="1018" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09b3833b-4e33-4797-b1aa-6e0fbcc9e601" />

To get visual feedback of drone position and telemetry use Mission Planner, or any other ground station software of your preference, and connect to UDP port `15630` (for wsl users this may not work, check the parameters section for uav_api.py and search for gs_connection for more).

# Flying through scripts
One of the perks of using Uav_control is simplifying UAV flights coordinated by scripts. Here are some examples:

## Simple Takeoff and Landing
This file is located at `flight_examples/takeoff_land.py`
```python
import requests
base_url = "http://localhost:8000"

# Arming vehicle
arm_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/command/arm")
if arm_result.status_code != 200:
    print(f"Arm command fail. status_code={arm_result.status_code}")
    exit()
print("Vehicle armed.")

# Taking off
params = {"alt": 30}
takeoff_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/command/takeoff", params=params)
if takeoff_result.status_code != 200:
    print(f"Take off command fail. status_code={takeoff_result.status_code}")
    exit()
print("Vehicle took off")

# Landing...
land_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/command/land")
if land_result.status_code != 200:
    print(f"Land command fail. status_code={land_result.status_code}")
    exit()
print("Vehicle landed.")
```


## NED Square
In this example the uav will move following a square with 100 meters side. This file is located at `flight_examples/ned_square`.
```python
import requests
base_url = "http://localhost:8000"

# Arming vehicle
arm_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/command/arm")
if arm_result.status_code != 200:
    print(f"Arm command fail. status_code={arm_result.status_code}")
    exit()
print("Vehicle armed.")

# Taking off
params = {"alt": 30}
takeoff_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/command/takeoff", params=params)
if takeoff_result.status_code != 200:
    print(f"Take off command fail. status_code={takeoff_result.status_code}")
    exit()
print("Vehicle took off")

square_points = [
    (100, 100, -50),
    (100, -100, -50),
    (-100, -100, -50),
    (-100, 100, -50)
]

# Moving
for point in square_points:
    point_data = {
        "x": point[0],
        "y": point[1],
        "z": point[2]
    }
    point_result = requests.post(f"{base_url}/movement/go_to_ned_wait", json=point_data)
    if point_result.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Go_to_ned_wait command fail. status_code={point_result.status_code} point={point}")
        exit()
    print(f"Vehicle at ({point[0]}, {point[1]}, {point[2]})")

# Returning to launch
rtl_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/command/rtl")
if rtl_result.status_code != 200:
    print(f"RTL command fail. status_code={rtl_result.status_code}")
    exit()
print("Vehicle landed at launch.")
```

## NED Square (Polling)
This example does the same thing as the last one but this time instead of using the `go_to_ned_wait` endpoint we will take a polling aproach using `go_to_ned`. While more verbose, this way of verifying position allows your program to do other things while the uav has not arrived to the specified location. This file is located at `flight_examples/ned_square_polling.py`.
```python
import requests
import time
import math

base_url = "http://localhost:8000"

def euclidean_distance(point1, point2):
    return math.sqrt((point1[0] - point2[0])**2 + (point1[1] - point2[1])**2 + (point1[2] - point2[2])**2)

def wait_for_point(point, max_error, timeout):
    start = time.time()
    while time.time() < start + timeout:
        ned_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/telemetry/ned")
        if ned_result.status_code != 200:
            print(f"Ned telemetry fail. status_code={ned_result.status_code}")
            exit()
        ned_pos = ned_result.json()["info"]["position"]
        print(ned_pos)
        ned_point = (ned_pos["x"], ned_pos["y"], ned_pos["z"])
        distance = euclidean_distance(point, ned_point)
        if distance < max_error:
            return True
    return False


# Arming vehicle
arm_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/command/arm")
if arm_result.status_code != 200:
    print(f"Arm command fail. status_code={arm_result.status_code}")
    exit()
print("Vehicle armed.")

# Taking off
params = {"alt": 30}
takeoff_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/command/takeoff", params=params)
if takeoff_result.status_code != 200:
    print(f"Take off command fail. status_code={takeoff_result.status_code}")
    exit()
print("Vehicle took off")

square_points = [
    (100, 100, -50),
    (100, -100, -50),
    (-100, -100, -50),
    (-100, 100, -50)
]

# Moving
for point in square_points:
    point_data = {
        "x": point[0],
        "y": point[1],
        "z": point[2]
    }
    point_result = requests.post(f"{base_url}/movement/go_to_ned", json=point_data)
    if point_result.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Go_to_ned command fail. status_code={point_result.status_code} point={point}")
        exit()

    arrived = wait_for_point(point, max_error=3, timeout=60)
    if not arrived:
        print(f"Error while going to point {point}")
        exit()
    print(f"Vehicle at ({point[0]}, {point[1]}, {point[2]})")

# Returning to launch
rtl_result = requests.get(f"{base_url}/command/rtl")
if rtl_result.status_code != 200:
    print(f"RTL command fail. status_code={rtl_result.status_code}")
    exit()
print("Vehicle landed at launch.")
```

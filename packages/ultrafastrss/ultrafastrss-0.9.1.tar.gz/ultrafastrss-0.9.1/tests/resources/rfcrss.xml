		<title>RFC 9766: Extensions for Weak Cache Consistency in NFSv4.2's Flexible File Layout</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9766</link>
		<description>This document specifies extensions to NFSv4.2 for improving Weak
Cache Consistency (WCC).  These extensions introduce mechanisms that
ensure partial writes performed under a Parallel NFS (pNFS) layout
remain coherent and correctly tracked. The solution addresses
concurrency and data integrity concerns that may arise when multiple
clients write to the same file through separate data servers. By
defining additional interactions among clients, metadata servers, and
data servers, this specification enhances the reliability of NFSv4 in
parallel-access environments and ensures consistency across diverse
deployment scenarios.</description>

		<title>RFC 9750: The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) Architecture</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9750</link>
		<description>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol (RFC 9420) provides a
group key agreement protocol for messaging applications. MLS is
designed to protect against eavesdropping, tampering, and message
forgery, and to provide forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise
security (PCS).  

This document describes the architecture for using MLS in a general
secure group messaging infrastructure and defines the security goals
for MLS.  It provides guidance on building a group messaging system
and discusses security and privacy trade-offs offered by multiple
security mechanisms that are part of the MLS protocol (e.g.,
frequency of public encryption key rotation). The document also
provides guidance for parts of the infrastructure that are not
standardized by MLS and are instead left to the application.

While the recommendations of this document are not mandatory to
follow in order to interoperate at the protocol level, they affect
the overall security guarantees that are achieved by a messaging
application. This is especially true in the case of active
adversaries that are able to compromise clients, the Delivery Service
(DS), or the Authentication Service (AS).</description>

		<title>RFC 9765: RADIUS/1.1: Leveraging Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) to Remove MD5</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9765</link>
		<description>This document defines Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
extensions for use with RADIUS/TLS and RADIUS/DTLS.  These extensions
permit the negotiation of an application protocol variant of RADIUS
called &quot;RADIUS/1.1&quot;.  No changes are made to RADIUS/UDP or
RADIUS/TCP. The extensions allow the negotiation of a transport
profile where the RADIUS shared secret is no longer used, and all
MD5-based packet authentication and attribute obfuscation methods are
removed.

This document updates RFCs 2865, 2866, 5176, 6613, 6614, and 7360.</description>

		<title>RFC 9767: Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol Resource Server Connections</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9767</link>
		<description>The Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP) defines a
mechanism for delegating authorization to a piece of software (the
client) and conveying the results and artifacts of that delegation to
the software. This extension defines methods for resource servers
(RSs) to connect with authorization servers (ASs) in an interoperable
fashion.</description>

		<title>RFC 9753: Extension for Stateful PCE to Allow Optional Processing of Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Objects</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9753</link>
		<description>This document introduces a mechanism to mark some of the Path
Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) objects as optional
during PCEP message exchange, so the stateful Path Computation
Element (PCE) model can relax some constraints during path
computation and setup. This document introduces this relaxation to
stateful PCE, and it updates RFC 8231.</description>

		<title>RFC 9761: Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) for TLS and DTLS Profiles for Internet of Things (IoT) Devices</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9761</link>
		<description>This memo extends the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD)
specification to allow manufacturers to define TLS and DTLS profile
parameters. This allows a network security service to identify
unexpected (D)TLS usage, which can indicate the presence of
unauthorized software, malware, or security policy-violating traffic
on an endpoint.</description>

		<title>RFC 9752: Conveying Vendor-Specific Information in the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9752</link>
		<description>This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element
Communication Protocol (PCEP) that enable the inclusion of
vendor-specific information in stateful Path Computation Element
(PCE) operations. These extensions allow vendors to incorporate
proprietary data within PCEP messages, facilitating enhanced network
optimization and functionality in environments requiring
vendor-specific features. The extensions maintain compatibility with
existing PCEP implementations and promote interoperability across
diverse network deployments. RFC 7470 defines a facility to carry
vendor-specific information in stateless PCEP messages. This document
extends this capability for the stateful PCEP messages.

This document updates RFC 7470 to specify that Enterprise Numbers are
managed through the &quot;Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs)&quot; registry.</description>

		<title>RFC 9719: YANG Data Model for Routing in Fat Trees (RIFT)</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9719</link>
		<description>This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration and
management of the Routing in Fat Trees (RIFT) Protocol. The model is
based on YANG 1.1, which is defined in RFC 7950 and conforms to the
Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as described in RFC
8342.</description>

		<title>RFC 9764: Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Encapsulated in Large Packets</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9764</link>
		<description>The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is commonly
used to verify connectivity between two systems.  BFD packets are
typically very small.  It is desirable in some circumstances to know
not only that the path between two systems is reachable, but also
that it is capable of carrying a payload of a particular size. This
document specifies how to implement such a mechanism using BFD in
Asynchronous mode. 

YANG modules for managing this mechanism are also defined in this
document.  These YANG modules augment the existing BFD YANG modules
defined in RFC 9314. The YANG modules in this document conform to the
Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) (RFC 8342).</description>

		<title>RFC 9692: RIFT: Routing in Fat Trees</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9692</link>
		<description>This document defines a specialized, dynamic routing protocol for
Clos, fat tree, and variants thereof. These topologies were initially
used within crossbar interconnects and consequently router and switch
backplanes, but their characteristics make them ideal for
constructing IP fabrics as well. The protocol specified by this
document is optimized towards the minimization of control plane state
to support very large substrates as well as the minimization of
configuration and operational complexity to allow for a simplified
deployment of said topologies.</description>

		<title>RFC 9696: Routing in Fat Trees (RIFT) Applicability and Operational Considerations</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9696</link>
		<description>This document discusses the properties, applicability, and
operational considerations of Routing in Fat Trees (RIFT) in
different network scenarios with the intention of providing a rough
guide on how RIFT can be deployed to simplify routing operations in
Clos topologies and their variations.</description>

		<title>RFC 9759: Unified Time Scaling for Temporal Coordination Frameworks</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9759</link>
		<description>Estimating time requirements for tasks, both critical and mundane,
remains a challenge in engineering, business, and everyday
communication.  Existing models fail due to inherent unpredictability
and inconsistencies in human estimation.  This document introduces
the Two-Week Principle (TWP), a novel, universally adaptable time
scale that seeks to standardize all temporal references to a
singular, uniform duration.  TWP ensures clarity, predictability, and
synchronization across all sectors that rely on time-based
scheduling.</description>

		<title>RFC 9726: Operational Considerations for Use of DNS in Internet of Things (IoT) Devices</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9726</link>
		<description>This document details considerations about how Internet of Things
(IoT) devices use IP addresses and DNS names.  These concerns become
acute as network operators begin deploying Manufacturer Usage
Descriptions (MUD), as specified in RFC 8520, to control device
access.

Also, this document makes recommendations on when and how to use DNS
names in MUD files.</description>

		<title>RFC 9777: Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6</title>
		<link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9777</link>
		<description>This document specifies the Multicast Listener Discovery version 2
(MLDv2) protocol.  MLD is used by an IPv6 router to discover the
presence of multicast listeners on directly attached links and to
discover which multicast addresses are of interest to those
neighboring nodes.  MLDv2 is designed to be interoperable with MLDv1.
 MLDv2 adds the ability for a node to report interest in listening to
packets with a particular multicast address only from specific source
addresses or from all sources except for specific source addresses.

This document updates RFC 2710 and obsoletes RFC 3810.</description>

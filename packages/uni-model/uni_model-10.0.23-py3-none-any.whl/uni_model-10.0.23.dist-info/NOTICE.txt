This project,includes files and code that are derived from the TensorFlow project. Specifically, the following Protobuf files from TensorFlow have been copied and used in this project:

attr_value.proto
full_type.proto
function.proto
graph.proto
node_def.proto
op_def.proto
resource_handle.proto
tensor.proto
tensor_shape.proto
types.proto
versions.proto

These files are used to generate Java and Python source files using protoc.

No modifications have been made to the Protobuf files listed above. They are identical to the versions provided in the TensorFlow project.

# upppdf - Unlock Password Protected PDF

**Pronunciation:** u triple p df

A Python package to unlock password-protected PDF files without requiring the password. This tool can remove password protection from PDFs and save them as unlocked versions using multiple advanced methods.

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install upppdf
```

### From Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew tap abozaralizadeh/brew
brew install upppdf
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abozar/PDF_Unlocker.git
cd PDF_Unlocker
pip install -e .
```

### Installation Methods Comparison

| Method | Platform | Dependencies | Command Available |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **PyPI** | All | Auto-installed | `upppdf` |
| **Homebrew** | macOS | Auto-installed | `upppdf` |
| **Source** | All | Manual | `upppdf` |

## ⚠️ Important: Encryption Limitations

**Not all PDFs can be unlocked without the password!** The script will automatically detect the encryption type and tell you if unlocking is possible:

- **🔒 Strong Encryption (R=3, AES-256)**: **Cannot be bypassed** - requires the actual password (minor chance with brute force)
- **🔓 Standard Encryption (R=2, RC4-128)**: **Can attempt bypass** - good success rate
- **🔓 Weak Encryption (R=1, RC4-40)**: **Can attempt bypass** - high success rate
- **🔓 No Encryption**: **Already accessible** - no action needed

## Features

- 🔓 **Multiple Unlocking Methods**: Uses qpdf, PyMuPDF, pikepdf, PyPDF2, and pdfcrack for maximum success rate
- 📁 **Batch Processing**: Process single files or entire directories
- 🎯 **Custom Directories**: Custom input and output directories
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress information and reporting
- 🛡️ **Smart Fallbacks**: Multiple methods with automatic fallback if one fails
- 🚀 **Automatic Dependencies**: Installs required libraries automatically
- ✅ **Verification**: Tests unlocked PDFs to ensure they're truly accessible
- 🔍 **Encryption Analysis**: Automatically detects encryption strength and limitations
- 💾 **Password Memory**: Remembers previously discovered passwords for faster processing

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- **qpdf** (command-line tool) - automatically installed via Homebrew on macOS
- **pdfcrack** (command-line tool) - for brute force password attempts
- Multiple PDF libraries for robust unlocking:
  - **qpdf** (recommended - command-line tool)
  - **pdfcrack** (brute force password cracking)
  - **PyMuPDF** (best content preservation)
  - **pikepdf** (most powerful)
  - **PyPDF2** (basic support)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   
   # Windows
   setup.bat
   ```

3. **Or install manually**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install command-line tools** (for best results):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install qpdf pdfcrack
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install qpdf pdfcrack
   
   # Windows
   # Download from https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/releases
   # Download pdfcrack from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcrack/
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Unlock all PDFs in the default `PDFs` folder:
```bash
upppdf
```

### Advanced Usage

Unlock a specific PDF file:
```bash
upppdf -f "filename.pdf"
```

Use custom input and output directories:
```bash
upppdf -i "/path/to/pdfs" -o "/path/to/output"
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--file` | `-f` | Specific PDF file to unlock | All PDFs |
| `--input-dir` | `-i` | Input directory containing PDFs | `PDFs` |
| `--output-dir` | `-o` | Output directory for unlocked PDFs | `Unlocked_PDFs` |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message | - |

## How It Works

The script uses a **multi-method approach** with **encryption strength detection**:

1. **Encryption Analysis**:
   - Detects encryption type (R=1, R=2, R=3)
   - Tells you immediately if unlocking is possible
   - Prevents wasting time on impossible tasks

2. **qpdf Method** (Most Reliable):
   - Command-line tool specifically designed for PDF manipulation
   - Best success rate for weak/standard encryption
   - Cannot bypass strong encryption (R=3)

3. **pdfcrack Method** (Brute Force):
   - Command-line tool for password cracking
   - Attempts to find passwords through brute force
   - Can be time-consuming but effective for weak passwords

4. **PyMuPDF Method** (Content Preservation):
   - Tries empty password and common passwords
   - Best for preserving content quality
   - Good fallback when other methods fail

5. **pikepdf Method** (Powerful):
   - Advanced PDF manipulation
   - Good for complex PDFs
   - Multiple password attempts

6. **PyPDF2 Method** (Basic):
   - Traditional decryption approach
   - Fallback for simple password protection

7. **Verification**:
   - Tests each unlocked PDF to ensure it's truly accessible
   - Checks for actual content (not just empty pages)
   - Removes failed attempts automatically

## Success Rates by Encryption Type

| Encryption Type | Success Rate | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| **R=3 (AES-256)** | **<1%** | Nearly impossible to bypass - requires password (minor chance with brute force) |
| **R=2 (RC4-128)** | **70-80%** | Can attempt bypass with multiple methods |
| **R=1 (RC4-40)** | **90-95%** | High success rate with any method |
| **No Encryption** | **100%** | Already accessible |

## Output

- Unlocked PDFs are saved with the prefix `unlocked_` in the output directory
- Original files remain unchanged
- Detailed progress information shows encryption type and unlockability
- Summary report shows success/failure counts
- **Verified unlocked PDFs** that are truly accessible without passwords

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Strong encryption (R=3) cannot be bypassed"**
   - This is **expected behavior** for secure PDFs
   - You need the actual password to unlock these
   - The script is working correctly by detecting this

2. **"No PDF libraries available"**
   - Run the setup script: `./setup.sh` or `setup.bat`
   - Or install manually: `pip install pikepdf pymupdf PyPDF2`

3. **"qpdf not available"**
   - Install qpdf: `brew install qpdf` (macOS) or `sudo apt-get install qpdf` (Ubuntu)
   - The script will still work with other methods

4. **"Permission denied"**
   - Ensure you have read/write permissions for input/output directories

### Error Messages

- **"Strong (R=3, AES-256)"**: Cannot be bypassed - requires password
- **"Standard (R=2, RC4-128)"**: Can attempt bypass - good chance of success
- **"Weak (R=1, RC4-40)"**: Can attempt bypass - high chance of success
- **"Successfully unlocked"**: Password protection was removed and verified

## When Unlocking Fails

If unlocking fails, it's usually because:

1. **Strong Encryption (R=3)**: This is **nearly impossible to bypass** - you need the password (minor chance with brute force)
2. **Corrupted PDF**: The file may be damaged
3. **Unsupported Encryption**: Very rare, but some custom encryption exists

**This is normal and expected** for properly secured PDFs!

## Security Note

⚠️ **Important**: This tool is intended for legitimate use cases such as:
- Recovering access to your own password-protected documents
- Processing documents where you have legal permission to remove protection
- Educational and research purposes

**The tool cannot bypass strong encryption (R=3)** - this is a security feature, not a bug! (though brute force may occasionally succeed)

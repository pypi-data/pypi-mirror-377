# U-stat estimator of variance / covariance
def varcovar(origX, origY, w=None, quiet=True):
    r'''
    U-stat estimator of variance / covariance for teacher effects
    X and Y are a J-by-:math:`\operatorname{max}(T_j)` matrix of teacher-specific mean residuals. 
    When X and Y are residuals for the same outcome and covariate group,
    code will return a estimate of variance of teacher effects. When X and Y
    differ (either in outcome or Xs), code returns an estimate of the 
    covariance. 

    Each row of X and Y are residuals for a specific teacher, ordered as
    first year observed, second year observed, etc. Since teachers have
    different number of years observed, X and Y should be np.NaN for all
    years after the last year observed. Each teacher must have at least
    2 years observed.

    X and Y must have the same dimension.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    origX: array
        J-by-:math:`\operatorname{max}(T_j)` array containing residuals/data for outcome X
    origY: array
        J-by-:math:`\operatorname{max}(T_j)` array containing residuals/data for outcome Y
    w: array
        (Optional) J-by-1 array of user-supplied weights. If supplied, varcovar will return row-weighted variance-covariance of row means. 
    quiet: boolean
        (Optional) If quiet=True, function call will report type of variance being calculated (unweighted/weighted) and whether panels are balanced or unbalanced.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Variance-covariance between rowmeans of origX and origY.

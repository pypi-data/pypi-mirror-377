`uvnote` is a "Stateless, deterministic notebooks with uv and Markdown."

In other words, its a alternative for Jupyter notebooks that is more lightweight, more reproducible, and more portable.

`uvnote` is kinda like a combination of a Markdown file and a Jupyter notebook and a static site generator.

## Concept

The premise is simple:

- you write normal markdown files with python code blocks
- each code block is expanded to a [uv/PEP 723 script](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#running-scripts)
- the output of each script is capture and rendered in the markdown file.
- all data/scripts are hashed and cached (in `.uvnote/cache`) so everything can be inspected and intelligently re-run when needed.
- no magic runtimes (relies on uv)
- no hidden state (cells are not stateful, they are just scripts)
- no special file formats (just plain markdown)

## Cool features

okay, so the core concept is simple (embed uv scripts in markdown), but there are some cool features that make `uvnote` more powerful than just that!

- interactive auto fading drawing tools to help present the note to others in an engaging way
- automatically generate a table of contents/links artifacts for easy navigation
- light/dark mode
- simplify syntax for dependencies (e.g. `deps=numpy,pandas` in code block header will be expanded to the PEP 723 metadata)
- and again NO MAGIC, so if you want to change css or add custom HTML you can easily do that.

## How to use

Currently, the recommended way to use `uvnote` is to directly run the script from GitHub using `uvx`, this will download and run the latest version of `uvnote` without needing to install anything until we have a proper release.

```bash
uvx uvnote
# Latest version
# uvx https://github.com/drbh/uvnote.git
```

outputs

### Preview

> [!NOTE]
> the vscode extension may be deprecated in the future as uvnote as the serve command can be used to serve a live preview.

If you're a `vscode` user, you can use the `uvnote-preview` extension to preview your uvnote files directly in VSCode.

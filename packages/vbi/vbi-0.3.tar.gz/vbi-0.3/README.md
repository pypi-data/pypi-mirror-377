## Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Create conda environment (recommended)
conda create --name vbi python=3.10
conda activate vbi


# Install VBI
export SKIP_CPP=1                  # To skip C++ compilation
pip install vbi                    # Light version (CPU only)
pip install vbi[inference]         # With parameter inference
pip install vbi[inference-gpu]     # Full functionality with GPU support
```

### Installation Options

- **`pip install vbi`** - Light version with CPU simulation only  
- **`pip install vbi[inference]`** - Adds parameter inference capabilities  
- **`pip install vbi[inference-gpu]`** - Full functionality with GPU acceleration  

### Using Docker

```bash
# Quick start with pre-built image
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/ins-amu/vbi:main

# With GPU support
docker run --gpus all --rm -it -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/ins-amu/vbi:main
```

### Other Installation Methods

abstract = {Network neuroscience has proven essential for understanding the principles and mechanisms
underlying complex brain (dys)function and cognition. In this context, whole-brain network modeling–
also known as virtual brain modeling–combines computational models of brain dynamics (placed at each network node)
with individual brain imaging data (to coordinate and connect the nodes), advancing our understanding of
the complex dynamics of the brain and its neurobiological underpinnings. However, there remains a critical
need for automated model inversion tools to estimate control (bifurcation) parameters at large scales
associated with neuroimaging modalities, given their varying spatio-temporal resolutions.
This study aims to address this gap by introducing a flexible and integrative toolkit for efficient Bayesian inference
on virtual brain models, called Virtual Brain Inference (VBI). This open-source toolkit provides fast simulations,
taxonomy of feature extraction, efficient data storage and loading, and probabilistic machine learning algorithms,
enabling biophysically interpretable inference from non-invasive and invasive recordings.
Through in-silico testing, we demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of inference for commonly used
whole-brain network models and their associated neuroimaging data. VBI shows potential to improve hypothesis
evaluation in network neuroscience through uncertainty quantification, and contribute to advances in precision
medicine by enhancing the predictive power of virtual brain models.}

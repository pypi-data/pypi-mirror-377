     abstract = {Network neuroscience has proven essential for understanding the principles and mechanisms
     underlying complex brain (dys)function and cognition. In this context, whole-brain network modeling–
     also known as virtual brain modeling–combines computational models of brain dynamics (placed at each network node)
     with individual brain imaging data (to coordinate and connect the nodes), advancing our understanding of
     the complex dynamics of the brain and its neurobiological underpinnings. However, there remains a critical
     need for automated model inversion tools to estimate control (bifurcation) parameters at large scales
     associated with neuroimaging modalities, given their varying spatio-temporal resolutions.
     This study aims to address this gap by introducing a flexible and integrative toolkit for efficient Bayesian inference
     on virtual brain models, called Virtual Brain Inference (VBI). This open-source toolkit provides fast simulations,
     taxonomy of feature extraction, efficient data storage and loading, and probabilistic machine learning algorithms,
     enabling biophysically interpretable inference from non-invasive and invasive recordings.
     Through in-silico testing, we demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of inference for commonly used
     whole-brain network models and their associated neuroimaging data. VBI shows potential to improve hypothesis
     evaluation in network neuroscience through uncertainty quantification, and contribute to advances in precision
     medicine by enhancing the predictive power of virtual brain models.}

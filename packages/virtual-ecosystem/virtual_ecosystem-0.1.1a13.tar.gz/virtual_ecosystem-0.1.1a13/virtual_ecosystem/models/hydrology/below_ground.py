    r"""Calculate vertical water flow through soil column, [mm d-1].

    To calculate the flow of water through unsaturated soil, this function combines
    Richards' equation and Darcy's law for unsaturated flow. It calculates the effective
    saturation :math:`S_{e}` and effective unsaturated hydraulic conductivity
    :math:`K(\Theta)` based on the moisture content :math:`\Theta` using the van
    Genuchten - Mualem model
    (:cite:t:`van_genuchten_closed-form_1980`, :cite:t:`mualem_new_1976`).

    First, the effective saturation is calculated as:

    .. math ::
        S_{e} = \frac{\Theta - \Theta_{r}}{\Theta_{s} - \Theta_{r}}

    where :math:`\Theta_{r}` is the soil moisture residual and :math:`\Theta_{s}` is
    the soil moisture saturation.

    Then, the effective unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is computed as:

    .. math ::
        K(\Theta) = K_{s} S_{e}^{L} (1-(1-S_{e}^{\frac{1}{m}})^{m})^{2}

    where :math:`K_{s}` is the saturated hydraulic conductivity,
    :math:`L` is the pore connectivity parameter, and :math:`m=1-1/n` is a shape
    parameter derived from the non-linearity parameter :math:`n`.

    The soil matric potential :math:`\Psi_{m}` is calculated as follows:

    .. math ::
        \Psi_{m} = \frac{1}{\alpha} (S_{e}^{-\frac{1}{m}}-1)^\frac{1}{n}

    where :math:`\alpha` is the inverse of air entry value.

    Then, the function applies Darcy's law to calculate the water flow rate
    :math:`q` in :math:`\frac{m}{s-1}` considering the effective unsaturated hydraulic
    conductivity:

    .. math ::
        q = - K(\Theta) (\frac{d \Psi_{m}}{dz} + 1)

    where :math:`\frac{d \Psi_{m}}{dz}` is the matric potential gradient with :math:`z`
    the elevation (gravitational potential) or gravitational head. The result is
    converted to mm per day.

    Note that there are severe limitations to this approach on the temporal and
    spatial scale of this model and this can only be treated as a very rough
    approximation!

    Groundwater storage and transport are modelled using two parallel linear reservoirs,
    similar to the approach used in the HBV-96 model
    :cite:p:`lindstrom_development_1997` and the LISFLOOD
    :cite:p:`van_der_knijff_lisflood_2010`.

    The upper zone represents a quick runoff component, which includes fast groundwater
    and subsurface flow through macro-pores in the soil. The lower zone represents the
    slow groundwater component that generates the base flow.

    The outflow from the upper zone to the channel, :math:`Q_{uz}`, [mm], equals:

    :math:`Q_{uz} = \frac{1}{T_{uz}} * UZ * \Delta t`

    where :math:`T_{uz}` is the reservoir constant for the upper groundwater layer
    [days], and :math:`UZ` is the amount of water that is stored in the upper zone [mm].
    The amount of water stored in the upper zone is computed as follows:

    :math:`UZ = D_{ls,gw} + D_{pref,gw} - D{uz,lz}`

    where :math:`D_{ls,gw}` is the flow from the lower soil layer to groundwater,
    :math:`D_{pref,gw}` is the amount of preferential flow or bypass flow per time step,
    :math:`D_{uz,lz}` is the amount of water that percolates from the upper to the lower
    zone, all in [mm].

    The water percolates from the upper to the lower zone is the inflow to the lower
    groundwater zone. This amount of water is provided by the upper groundwater zone.
    :math:`D_{uz,lz}` is a fixed amount per computational time step and it is defined as
    follows:

    :math:`D_{uz,lz} = min(GW_{perc} * \Delta t, UZ)`

    where :math:`GW_{perc}`, [mm day], is the maximum percolation rate from the upper to
    the lower groundwater zone. The outflow from the lower zone to the channel is then
    computed by:

    :math:`Q_{lz} = \frac{1}{T_{lz}} * LZ * \Delta t`

    :math:`T_{lz}` is the reservoir constant for the lower groundwater layer, [days],
    and :math:`LZ` is the amount of water that is stored in the lower zone, [mm].
    :math:`LZ` is computed as follows:

    :math:`LZ = D_{uz,lz} - (GW_{loss} * \Delta t)`

    where :math:`D_{uz,lz}` is the percolation from the upper groundwater zone,[mm],
    and :math:`GW_{loss}` is the maximum percolation rate from the lower groundwater
    zone, [mm day].

    The amount of water defined by :math:`GW_{loss}` never rejoins the river channel and
    is lost beyond the catchment boundaries or to deep groundwater systems. The larger
    the value of ath:`GW_{loss}`, the larger the amount of water that leaves the system.

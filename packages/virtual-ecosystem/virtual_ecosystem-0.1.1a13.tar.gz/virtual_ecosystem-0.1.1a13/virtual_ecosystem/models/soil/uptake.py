    """Calculate the rate at which microbes uptake each nutrient.

    These rates are found based on the assumption that microbial stoichiometry is
    inflexible, i.e. assuming that the rate of uptake of all nutrients (carbon, nitrogen
    and phosphorus) needed for growth will be set by the least available nutrient. The
    carbon case is more complex as carbon gets used both for biomass synthesis and
    respiration. In this case, we calculate the carbon use efficiency and use this to
    find the maximum amount of carbon available for biomass synthesis. Once the most
    limiting nutrient uptake stream is found it is straightforward to find the demand
    for other nutrients. This is because the microbial biomass stoichiometry can only
    remain the same if nutrients are taken up following the same stoichiometry (with an
    adjustment made for carbon use efficiency).

    Biomass synthesis is split between the synthesis of new cellular biomass and the
    production of extracellular enzymes. We assume that extracellular enzymes are always
    produced in fixed proportion to the rate at which new biomass is synthesised. As
    such, we calculate the nutrient costs of synthesising new biomass based on a
    weighted (by relative investment in production) average of the stoichiometry of the
    different enzymes and the microbial group itself.

    The balance of mineralisation and immobilisation rates of inorganic nitrogen and
    phosphorus are also calculated in this function. This is done by calculating the
    difference between the demand for nitrogen and phosphorus and their uptake due to
    organic matter uptake. If more is taken up as a component of organic matter than is
    needed then nutrients are mineralised, i.e. mass is added to the relevant inorganic
    nutrient pool. Conversely, if more is required to meet demand uptake occurs from the
    relevant inorganic nutrient pool (this is termed immobilisation). Two forms
    inorganic nitrogen can be taken up by microbes, ammonium and nitrate. The rate at
    which these are taken up is determined by the ratio of their uptake rates. When
    inorganic nitrogen is mineralised the ratio of ammonium to nitrate mineralised is
    determined by a fixed ratio defined in the model constants.

    Symbiotic microbes can end up with negative growth rates, when the nutrient demands
    from plants are large enough that symbiotic microbes have to start breaking down
    their existing biomass. The stoichiometric balance for this is handled within the
    uptake functions, so this biomass loss is subtracted from the biomass pool size, but
    is not added to the necromass.

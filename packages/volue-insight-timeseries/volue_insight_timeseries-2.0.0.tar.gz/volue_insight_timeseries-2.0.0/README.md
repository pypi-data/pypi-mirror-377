# volue-insight-timeseries
Volue Insight API python library for working with timeseries.

This library is meant as a simple toolkit for working with data from
https://api.volueinsight.com/ (or equivalent services). Note that access
is based on having a valid Volue Insight account. Please contact
sales.insight@volue.com in order to get a trial account.

The library is tested against Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13. Please only use either of these python versions.


## Documentation

The 
[documentation](https://wattsight-volue-insight-timeseries.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/master/) 
with various 
[examples](https://wattsight-volue-insight-timeseries.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/master/examples.html)
is hosted on Read the Docs.

## Installation

You can simply install/update the latest version of Volue Insight API python
library with pip.
Start a terminal (a shell) and use the following command

```bash
pip install -U volue-insight-timeseries
```

### Pin this package
We strongly recommend to pin your dependency on our package, since we will do
changes to the package as we introduce new features, fix issues etc. See example
below. At least make sure you lock down the major version in your
requirements.txt file in order to prevent your code to break when we do
breaking changes.

```bash
# your requirements.txt

volue-insight-timeseries==1.0.0 # Good
volue-insight-timeseries # Bad
```

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0-rc.2.html)
principles to communicate the type of change from one version to the next,
together with [release notes](https://github.com/volueinsight/volue-insight-timeseries/releases).

## Migrating from wapi-python
If you previously have used wapi-python, you should switch to use this package
going forward. We will not add any new features to wapi-python, it is only in 
the event of a severe bug that we will do any changes to it.

These are the steps you will have to do in order to successfully
make the switch. 

* Use Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13
* Use Pandas 1.5.0 or newer for python 3.10-3.12. Use Pandas 2.2.3 or newer for python 3.13 or newer
* Use [zoneinfo](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zoneinfo.html), not pytz for handling time zone information

### Example of migrating an existing script
Assume you want to migrate the script below. It is a very simple script to
highlight things that are changing, not a recommended way to write production
code.

```python
# python 3.10.18
# pip install wapi-python==0.7.15
# pip install python-dotenv==1.0.1
#
# ---
# .env file contents
# CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
# CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

import os
import wapi
from wapi.util import TS
from wapi.curves import InstanceCurve
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
session = wapi.Session(client_id=(os.environ['CLIENT_ID']),
                       client_secret=(os.environ['CLIENT_SECRET']))

results = session.search(name="tt no2 con ec00 °c cet min15 f")
if results:
    instance_curve: InstanceCurve = results[0]
    data: TS = instance_curve.get_latest(data_to="2030-04-01T04:00Z")
    print(f"Curve type: {data.curve_type}")
    print(f"Time zone class of curve data: {type(data.tz)}")

# Output
# Curve type: INSTANCES
# Time zone class of curve data: <class 'pytz.tzfile.CET'>
```

The migrated script is below

```python
# python 3.10.18
# pip install volue-insight-timeseries==1.2.0
# pip install python-dotenv==1.0.1
#
# ---
# .env file contents
# CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
# CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

import os
import volue_insight_timeseries as vit
from volue_insight_timeseries.util import TS
from volue_insight_timeseries.curves import InstanceCurve
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
session = vit.Session(client_id=(os.environ['CLIENT_ID']),
                      client_secret=(os.environ['CLIENT_SECRET']))

results = session.search(name="tt no2 con ec00 °c cet min15 f")
if results:
    instance_curve: InstanceCurve = results[0]
    data: TS = instance_curve.get_latest(data_to="2030-04-01T04:00Z")
    print(f"Curve type: {data.curve_type}")
    print(f"Time zone class of curve data: {type(data.tz)}")

# Output
# Curve type: INSTANCES
# Time zone class of curve data: <class 'zoneinfo.ZoneInfo'>
```

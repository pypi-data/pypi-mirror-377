def project_to_plane(points, plane_point, plane_normal):
    """
    Projects a set of 3D points onto a plane defined by a point and normal vector.

    This function takes a collection of 3D points and projects them onto a plane defined by
    a point on the plane and its normal vector. The projection is done by finding the closest
    point on the plane for each input point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : list or numpy.ndarray
        Array of 3D points to be projected, where each point is a 3-element array
    plane_point : numpy.ndarray
        A point that lies on the plane, represented as a 3-element array
    plane_normal : numpy.ndarray
        The normal vector of the plane, represented as a 3-element array

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list of 2D coordinates representing the projected points on the plane,
        where each coordinate is a tuple of (u, v) values in the plane's coordinate system

    Notes
    -----
    - The plane's coordinate system is created using an orthogonal basis
    - The normal vector is automatically normalized
    - If the normal vector is parallel to the x-axis, an alternative basis vector is used

def unproject_to_3d(projected_points, plane_point, plane_normal):
    """
    Reconstructs 3D points from their 2D projections on a plane.

    This function takes a set of 2D points that were previously projected onto a plane
    and reconstructs their original 3D positions on that plane. The reconstruction uses
    the plane's point and normal vector to establish the coordinate system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    projected_points : list of tuple
        List of 2D coordinates (u, v) representing points projected onto the plane
    plane_point : numpy.ndarray
        A point that lies on the plane, represented as a 3-element array
    plane_normal : numpy.ndarray
        The normal vector of the plane, represented as a 3-element array

    Returns
    -------
    list of numpy.ndarray
        A list of 3D points reconstructed on the plane, where each point is a 3-element array

    Notes
    -----
    - The plane's coordinate system is recreated using an orthogonal basis
    - The normal vector is automatically normalized
    - This function is the inverse operation of project_to_plane

def map_to_plane(points_2d, plane_point, plane_normal):
    """
    Maps 2D points onto a 3D plane defined by a point and normal vector.

    This function takes a set of 2D points and maps them onto a 3D plane using the plane's
    point and normal vector to establish the coordinate system. The mapping creates a
    one-to-one correspondence between 2D coordinates and points on the 3D plane.

    points_2d : list of tuple
        List of 2D coordinates (u, v) to be mapped onto the plane
    plane_point : numpy.ndarray
        A point that lies on the plane, represented as a 3-element array
    plane_normal : numpy.ndarray

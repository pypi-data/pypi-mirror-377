def read_txt(sys, file=None):
    """
    Reads atom data from a text file and populates the system with atom objects.

    This function processes a text file containing atom coordinates and radii, creating
    atom objects that are added to the system. The file can be either space-delimited
    or comma-delimited, with each line containing:
    - X coordinate
    - Y coordinate
    - Z coordinate
    - Radius

    Parameters:
    -----------
    sys : System
        The system object to populate with atoms
    file : str, optional
        Path to the text file containing atom data. If None, uses sys.files['base_file']

    Returns:
    --------
    None
        Modifies the system object in place by:
        - Creating atom objects from the file data
        - Adding atoms to sys.balls
        - Initializing empty lists for sys.residues and sys.chains

    """
    Creates a 3D cylindrical line segment between points using triangular mesh representation.

    This function generates a triangular mesh representation of a cylindrical line segment
    connecting a series of points in 3D space. The cylinder is constructed using triangular
    faces and can be customized with different radii and colors.

    Args:
        points (list of numpy.ndarray): List of 3D points to connect with the line segment
        radius (float, optional): Radius of the cylindrical line segment. Defaults to 0.02
        color (tuple, optional): RGB color tuple for the line segment. Defaults to None
        edge_org (numpy.ndarray, optional): Vector defining the orientation of the edge.
            Defaults to [0, 0, 1] if not specified

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - draw_points (list): List of 3D points defining the vertices of the triangular mesh
            - draw_tris (list): List of triangular faces connecting the vertices

        Returns True if no other centers are within the radius 'rad' from 'loc', otherwise returns False

    Notes

    This function iterates over each center in 'test_locs' to check if 'loc' is outside the specified
    'rad'. The function is optimized with Numba's nopython mode for faster execution.

def verify_pow(loc, rad, test_locs, test_rads):
    """
    Verify if a sphere does not overlap with any other spheres.

    This function determines if a given sphere (defined by its center 'loc' and 'rad') does not overlap
    with any other spheres in a given list. This function is optimized for use in power diagram
    computations and is compiled with Numba for performance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loc : numpy.ndarray
        The center of the sphere to verify
    rad : float
        The radius of the sphere to verify
    test_locs : numpy.ndarray
        An array of centers of other spheres to check against
    test_rads : numpy.ndarray or list
        An array or list of radii corresponding to the centers in 'test_locs'

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Returns True if the sphere does not overlap with any other spheres in the list, otherwise False

    Notes
    -----
    The function iterates over a list of spheres defined by 'test_locs' and 'test_rads'. It checks for
    non-overlapping conditions by comparing the squared distance between sphere centers to the squared
    sum of radii. This function is suitable for high-performance computational needs due to its
    compilation with Numba, which translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime.
    """

    # Iterate through each sphere in the list to check for overlaps
    for i, b_loc in enumerate(test_locs):
        b_rad = test_rads[i]  # Get the radius for the current sphere
        # Calculate the squared distance and compare it to the squared sum of radii
        if calc_dist_numba(b_loc, loc) ** 2 - b_rad ** 2 < rad:
            return False  # Overlap detected, return False

    return True  # No overlaps found, return True


def verify_site(loc, rad, test_locs, test_rads, net_type='aw'):
    """
    Check if a site (vertex) overlaps with other sites.

    This function checks if a given site (vertex) specified by its location and radius overlaps with
    other sites. It can adapt to different network types by selecting appropriate verification methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loc : array-like or numpy.ndarray
        The location of the vertex as coordinates
    rad : float
        The radius of the vertex
    test_locs : list or numpy.ndarray
        A collection of locations for other sites to test against
    test_rads : list or numpy.ndarray
        Radii corresponding to each location in test_locs
    net_type : str, optional
        Type of network to use for verification. Options include 'aw' for atomic weaving,
        'prm' for probabilistic roadmaps, and 'pow' for power diagrams

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the site is verified (does not overlap or meets criteria specific to the network type),
        False otherwise

    Notes
    -----
    The function first ensures that the 'loc' parameter is a numpy.ndarray. It then delegates the
    actual overlap checking to specific functions based on the network type: 'aw' for atomic weaving
    networks, 'prm' for probabilistic roadmaps, and 'pow' for power diagrams. These specific functions
    check for conditions like overlapping or proximity based on network-specific rules.

    # Ensure the location is in numpy array format for consistency in mathematical operations
    if not isinstance(loc, np.ndarray):
        loc = np.array(loc)

    # Call the appropriate function to verify the site based on the type of network
    if net_type == 'aw':
        return verify_aw(loc, rad, test_locs, test_rads)
    elif net_type == 'prm':

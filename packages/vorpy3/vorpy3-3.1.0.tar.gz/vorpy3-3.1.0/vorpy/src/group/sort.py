def get_info(group):
    """
    Gathers and calculates comprehensive information about a molecular group, including geometric, physical, and structural properties.

    This function performs a detailed analysis of a molecular group, calculating:
    - Surface area and volume metrics
    - Center of mass (both geometric and van der Waals)
    - Mass and density properties
    - Moment of inertia tensors
    - Layer-based surface properties

    Parameters:
        group (Group): The Group object to analyze. Must have a valid network (group.net) and ball indices (group.ball_ndxs).

    Returns:
        None. Results are stored in the Group object's attributes:
        - sa (float): Total surface area of the group
        - vol (float): Total volume of the group
        - vdw_vol (float): Van der Waals volume
        - density (float): Ratio of van der Waals volume to total volume
        - mass (float): Total mass of atoms
        - com (numpy.ndarray): Center of mass coordinates
        - vdw_com (list): Van der Waals center of mass
        - spatial_moment (list): Spatial moment tensor
        - moi (list): Moment of inertia tensor

    Examples:
        >>> from vorpy.src.group import Group
        >>> # Create and analyze a group
        >>> group = Group(sys=my_system, name='protein_A')

def add_balls(grp, ball_list):

    Adds atoms to a group while maintaining sorted order and preventing duplicates.

    This function efficiently integrates new atoms into a group's existing atom list. It uses binary search
    to maintain a sorted order of atom indices and ensures no duplicate atoms are added. The function
    handles various input types including lists of atoms from molecules, residues, or direct atom selections.

    Parameters:
        grp (Group): The Group object to which atoms will be added
        ball_list (list): List of atom indices to be added to the group. Can be from various sources
                         (e.g., molecule.atoms, residue.atoms, or direct atom selections)

    Returns:
        None. The group's ball_ndxs and atms attributes are updated with the new atoms.

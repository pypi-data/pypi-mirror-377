def mark_doublets(verts):
    """
    Marks vertices as doublets by checking if they share the same set of balls with other vertices.

    This function identifies doublet vertices by:
    1. Tracking which vertices each ball participates in
    2. Checking if a new vertex shares the same set of balls with an existing vertex
    3. Marking vertices as doublets (1) or non-doublets (0)

    Parameters
    ----------
    verts : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing vertex information with columns:
        - 'balls': List of ball indices forming the vertex
        - Other vertex properties

    Returns
    -------
    list
        List of integers where:
        - 0 indicates a non-doublet vertex
        - 1 indicates a doublet vertex
        Returns None if input is not a pandas DataFrame

    Notes
    -----
    - Doublets are vertices that share the same set of balls
    - Only checks the first ball in each vertex's ball list since indices are sorted
    - Maintains a dictionary mapping balls to their participating vertices
    - Requires input to be in pandas DataFrame format

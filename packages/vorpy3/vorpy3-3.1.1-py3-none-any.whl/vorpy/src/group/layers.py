    """
    Performs layer-based analysis of a molecular group by identifying concentric layers of atoms and surfaces.

    This function analyzes the spatial organization of atoms and surfaces around a given group by identifying
    successive layers of neighboring atoms and their associated surfaces. It can optionally group residues
    together to maintain molecular integrity (e.g., keeping water molecules intact).

    Parameters:
        grp (Group): The Group object to analyze
        max_layers (int, optional): Maximum number of layers to identify (default: 50)
        group_resids (bool, optional): If True, keeps residues together in layers (default: True)
        build_surfs (bool, optional): If True, builds surfaces for the identified layers (default: True)

    Returns:
        None. Results are stored in the Group object's layer attributes:
        - layer_atoms: List of atom indices organized by layer
        - layer_surfs: List of surface indices organized by layer
        - layer_verts: List of vertex indices organized by layer
        - layer_edges: List of edge indices organized by layer
        - layer_info: List of layer-specific information (atoms, surface area, volume)

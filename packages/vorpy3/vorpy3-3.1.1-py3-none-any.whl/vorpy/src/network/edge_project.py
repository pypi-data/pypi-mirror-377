def edge_project(rn, pa, f):
    """
    Projects an edge onto a surface defined by a polynomial equation. Calculates the intersection points of a line,
    defined by a point and a direction, with a surface defined by a polynomial equation.

    Args:
        rn (numpy.ndarray): The direction vector of the line.
        pa (numpy.ndarray): A point on the line.
        f (numpy.ndarray): Coefficients of the polynomial defining the surface.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The point on the surface closest to the starting point 'pa' along the direction 'rn' that
                       intersects the surface defined by 'func'.

    Notes:
        - The polynomial is assumed to be of the form:
          f(x, y, z) = f[0]*x^2 + f[1]*y^2 + f[2]*z^2 + f[3]*xy + f[4]*yz + f[5]*zx +
                       f[6]*x + f[7]*y + f[8]*z + f[9]
        - The function calculates the coefficients of the quadratic equation in t, obtained by substituting
          the parametric equations of the line into the polynomial equation.
        - It then solves this quadratic equation to find the values of t that correspond to the intersection points.

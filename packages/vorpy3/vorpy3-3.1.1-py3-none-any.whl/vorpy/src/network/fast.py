    """
    Searches for a valid vertex site by iteratively expanding the search area around edge balls.

    This function implements a progressive search strategy that starts with a small area around
    the edge balls and gradually increases the search radius until either a valid vertex is found
    or the maximum search distance is reached. The search can be constrained to specific groups
    of balls and supports different network types (aw, pow, prm).

    Chooses a valid vertex from a set of potential vertices by verifying their validity.

    This function takes a potential vertex and verifies if it can form a valid vertex with the given edge balls.
    It checks both possible vertex locations (if they exist) and returns the first valid one found.
    If no valid vertex is found, it returns None along with an extra ball that was part of the invalid vertex.

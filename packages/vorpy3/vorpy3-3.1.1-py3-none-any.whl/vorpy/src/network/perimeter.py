def build_perimeter(locs, rads, epnts, net_type='aw'):
    """
    Builds a perimeter by sorting and connecting edge points in a continuous loop around a surface.

    This function takes a set of edge points and organizes them into a continuous perimeter by:
    1. Starting with the first edge's points
    2. Finding the closest remaining edge points to continue the perimeter
    3. Connecting edges in either forward or reverse order to maintain continuity

    Parameters
    ----------
    locs : list of numpy.ndarray
        List of ball locations in 3D space
    rads : list of float
        List of ball radii
    epnts : list of list of numpy.ndarray
        List of edge points, where each edge is a list of points
    net_type : str, optional
        Type of network ('aw', 'pow', or 'prm'), defaults to 'aw'

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing:
        - perimeter : list of numpy.ndarray
            Ordered list of points forming the continuous perimeter
        - surf_loc : numpy.ndarray
            Location of the surface center
        - surf_norm : numpy.ndarray
            Normal vector of the surface

    Notes
    -----
    - The function ensures the perimeter forms a continuous loop by connecting edges at their closest points
    - Edge points can be added in reverse order if it provides a better connection
    - The surface location and normal are calculated based on the network type
    - For 'aw' networks, the surface is positioned at the average of the ball radii
    - For 'prm' networks, the surface is positioned at the midpoint between balls
    - For 'pow' networks, the surface position is calculated using the power diagram formula

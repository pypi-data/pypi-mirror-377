    """
    Read and process a network file into a network object.

    This function parses a network file containing vertex, edge, and surface data,
    and integrates it into a network object. The file format includes:
    - Network settings (type, resolution, vertex limits, etc.)
    - Vertex data with coordinates and atom indices
    - Edge data connecting vertices
    - Surface data with triangulation information
    - Connection data linking vertices to edges and surfaces

    Parameters:
    -----------
    net : Network
        The network object to populate with the parsed data
    file_name : str
        Path to the network file to be read

    Returns:
    --------
    Network
        The modified network object containing the integrated data

    Notes:
    ------
    - Supports CSV format with specific section headers (n, v, e, s, c)
    - Integrates vertices, edges, surfaces, and their connections
    - Updates network settings and metrics

# Docs creation

In order to build the docs you need to

1. install sphinx and additional support packages
2. build the package reference files
3. run sphinx to create a local html version

The documentation is build using readthedocs automatically.

Install the docs dependencies of the package (as speciefied in toml):

```bash
# in main folder
# pip install ".[docs]"
poetry install --with docs
```

## Build docs using Sphinx command line tools

Command to be run from `path/to/docs`, i.e. from within the `docs` package folder:

Options:

- `--separate` to build separate pages for each (sub-)module

```bash
# pwd: docs
# apidoc
sphinx-apidoc --force --implicit-namespaces --module-first -o reference ../src/vuecore
# build docs
sphinx-build -n -W --keep-going -b html ./ ./_build/
```

## Include repo README.md into docs

Relative links are used in the main README, which need to be resolved when building. It's
possible to include the a `relative-docs` option if one uses `index.md` ([see docs](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/index.html#include-a-file-from-outside-the-docs-folder-like-readme-md)). This does not work
with `href` links, only native markdown links.

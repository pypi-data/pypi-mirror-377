GMX Market Data Module

This module provides comprehensive access to GMX protocol market data through
a unified, high-level interface. It implements the Data Access Object (DAO)
pattern to abstract the complexity of the underlying GMX Python SDK while
providing consistent, well-structured access to all market information.

The module serves as the primary gateway for retrieving real-time and historical
market data from the GMX protocol, including liquidity metrics, pricing information,
funding rates, open interest, and user position data.

**Key Features:**

- **Unified Interface**: Single class providing access to all market data types
- **Read-Only Operations**: Safe data access without transaction capabilities
- **Multi-Network**: Automatic network detection and appropriate data sourcing
- **Real-Time Data**: Direct integration with GMX protocol APIs and contracts

**Data Categories:**

- **Market Information**: Available markets, liquidity, and trading pairs
- **Pricing Data**: Oracle prices, GM token prices, and funding rates
- **Liquidity Metrics**: TVL, available liquidity, and pool balances
- **Trading Metrics**: Open interest, borrowing rates, and funding APR
- **User Data**: Individual position information and claimable fees

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Basic market data access
    web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc"))
    config = GMXConfig(web3)
    market_data = GMXMarketData(config)

    # Get current market overview
    markets = market_data.get_available_markets()
    liquidity = market_data.get_available_liquidity()
    open_interest = market_data.get_open_interest()

    # Access pricing information
    oracle_prices = market_data.get_oracle_prices()
    gm_prices = market_data.get_gm_price()

    # Monitor funding and borrowing costs
    funding_rates = market_data.get_funding_apr()
    borrow_rates = market_data.get_borrow_apr()

    # Check user positions (requires wallet address)
    user_positions = market_data.get_user_positions("0x742d...")

Note:
    This module uses read-only configuration to ensure safe data access without
    requiring wallet credentials or transaction signing capabilities.

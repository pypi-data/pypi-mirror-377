# whatsthedamage

An opinionated open source tool written in Python to process K&H HU's bank account transaction exports in CSV files.

The predefined settings works best with CSVs exported from K&H HU, but I made efforts to customize the behavior and potentially work with any other CSV format other finance companies may produce.

The project contains a web interface using Flask.

An experimental Machine Learning model already exists to help reducing the burden of writing regular expressions.

## Why?

I tried some self-hosted software like [Firefly III](https://www.firefly-iii.org/) and [Actualbudget](https://actualbudget). to create detailed reports about my accounting. However, I found that either the learning curve is too high or the burden of manually categorizing transactions is too great.

I wanted something much simpler to use that still provides the required details and works with transaction exports that one can download from their online banking.

## The name

The slang phrase "what's the damage?" is often used to ask about the cost or price of something, typically in a casual or informal context. The phrase is commonly used in social settings, especially when discussing expenses or the results of an event.

## Features:
 - Categorizes transactions into well known accounting categories like deposits, payments, etc.
 - Categorizes transactions into custom categories by using regular expressions.
 - Transactions can be filtered by start and end dates. If no filter is set, grouping is based on the number of months.
 - Shows a report about the summarized amounts grouped by transaction categories.
 - Reports can be saved as CSV file as well.
 - Localization support. Currently English (default) and Hungarian languages are supported.
 - Web interface for easier use.

### Machine Learning categorization (experimental)

Writing regular expressions might be easy for IT professionals, but it is definitely hard or even impossible for others. Maintaining them can also be challenging, even for professionals.

Using a machine learning model can automatically learn patterns from a given transaction history, making categorization faster and probably more accurate without manual rule creation.

If you want to read more about the ML model used by `whatsthedamage`, check out its own [README.md](src/whatsthedamage/scripts/README.md) file.

The repository has an experimental pre-built model.  

The model currently relies on the English language. Language-agnostic models are planned for the future.

**Warning**
 - The model is expected to be opinionated. Predicted categories could be completely wrong.
 - The model is currently persisted using 'joblib', which may pose a security risk of executing arbitrary code upon loading. __Use the model you trust; use it at your own risk.__

Try experimenting with it by providing the `--ml` command line argument to `whatsthedamage`.

## Install

Use `pipx install .` to deploy the package.

## Usage:
```
usage: whatsthedamage [-h] [--start-date START_DATE] [--end-date END_DATE] [--verbose] [--version] [--config CONFIG] [--category CATEGORY] [--no-currency-format] [--output OUTPUT]

                      filename

A CLI tool to process KHBHU CSV files.

positional arguments:
  filename              The CSV file to read.

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --start-date START_DATE
                        Start date (e.g. YYYY.MM.DD.)

```

## Web interface

Currently you can only run it locally by using Flask.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd src/whatsthedamage
python3 -m flask run
```

Access the web interface on [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000).

## Things which need attention

- The categorization process may fail to categorize transactions because of the quality of the regular expressions. In such situations the transaction will be categorized as 'other'.
- The tool assumes that account exports only use a single currency.

### Configuration File (config.yml):

The config file format and syntax has considerably changed in v0.6.0. Please refer to the default config file for details.

A default configuration file is provided as `config.yml.default`. The installed package installs it to `<venv>/whatsthedamage/share/doc/whatsthedamage/config.yml.default`.

## Troubleshooting
In case you want to troubleshoot why a certain transaction got into a specific category, turn on verbose mode by setting either `-v` or `--verbose` on the command line.  
By default only those attributes (columns) are printed which are set in `selected_attributes` in config file. The attribute `category` is created by the tool.

Should you want to check your regular expressions then you can use a handy online tool like https://regex101.com/.

Note: Regexp values are not stored as raw strings, so watch out for possible backslashes. For more information, see [What exactly is a raw string regex and how can you use it?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12871066/what-exactly-is-a-raw-string-regex-and-how-can-you-use-it).

### Transaction categories

A list of frequent transaction categories a bank account may have.

- **Balance**: Your total balance per time period. Basically the sum of all deposits minus the sum of all your purchases.
- **Clothes**: Clothing related purchases.
- **Deposit**: Money added to the account, such as direct deposits from employers, cash deposits, or transfers from other accounts.
- **Fee**: Charges applied by the bank, such as monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, or ATM fees.
- **Grocery**: Everything considered to sustain your life. Mostly food and other basic things required by your household.
- **Health**: Medicines, vising a doctor, etc.
- **Home Maintenance**: Spendings on your housing, maintencance, reconstruction, etc.
- **Interest**: Earnings on the account balance, typically seen in savings accounts or interest-bearing checking accounts.
- **Loan**: Any type of loans, mortgage.
- **Other**: Any transactions which do not fit into any of the other categories.
- **Payment**: Scheduled payments for bills or loans, which can be set up as automatic payments.
- **Purchase**: Transactions made using a debit card or checks to pay for goods and services. (This is not explicitly used by `whatsthedamage`)
- **Refund**: Money returned to the account, often from returned purchases or corrections of previous transactions.
- **Sports Recreation**: Spending related to sports and recreations like massage, going into a bar or cinema.
- **Transfer**: Movements of money between accounts, either within the same bank or to different banks.
- **Utility**: Regular, monthly recurring payments for stuff like Rent, Electricity, Gas, Water, Phone bills, etc.
- **Vehicle**: All purchases - except Insurance - related to owning a vehicle.
- **Withdrawal**: Money taken out of the account, including ATM withdrawals, cash withdrawals at the bank, and electronic transfers.

Custom categories (like "Vehicle", "Grocery", etc.) are user-defined via config, and the listed categories are just examples. Feel free to add your own categories into config.yml.

## Localization

The application by default uses the English language and it has optional support for Hungarian.

1. Install and configure `babel` and `poedit`.  
```bash
pipx install babel
cat <<EOL > babel.cfg
[python: **.py]
[jinja2: **.html]
extensions=jinja2.ext.i18n
EOL
```

2. Extract translatable strings into a .pot file:  
```bash
pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o src/whatsthedamage/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.pot src/whatsthedamage/
```

3. Edit the .po file to add translations (creates the .mo file upon Save):
```bash
poedit locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
```

4. (optional) Compile the .po file into a .mo file. Poedit will do this for you:
```bash
msgfmt locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po -o locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo
```

## Bugs, TODO

- Fix time skew issues:
  - The 'könyvelés dátuma' attribute is most likely in local time but converting into epoch assumes UTC. Without timezone information we can only guess.
  - The arguments `--start-date` and `--end-date` assumes hours, minutes and seconds to be 00:00:00 and not 23:59:59.
- Migrate joblib to skops.io or ONNX.
- A docker image is planned for the future to make it easier to start using it.

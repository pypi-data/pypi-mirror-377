# wofryimpl

WOFRYIMPL is the standard implementation of the wofry library. It contains models and algorithms implementing the physics of the wavefronts, beamline element and propagators in free-space. 

WOFRYIMPL is used by OASYS-WOFRY https://github.com/oasys-kit/OASYS-WOFRY in the OASYS https://oasys-kit.github.io/ environment to run beamline simulations in a visual environment. It can also be installed outside OASYS to run the scripts generated by OASYS-WOFRY.

A description of the methods implemented in WOFRYIMPL can be found in https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.01338

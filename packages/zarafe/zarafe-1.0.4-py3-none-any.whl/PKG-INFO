# Zarafe <img src="https://github.com/mh-salari/zarafe/raw/main/resources/app_icon.ico" alt="zarafe" width="30" height="30">

Zarafe is an open-source video annotation tool that unifies time-based event marking across different head-mounted eye trackers through a single, easy-to-use interface.

## Why Zarafe?

Working with different head-mounted eye trackers means dealing with multiple proprietary software tools for annotation. This creates several challenges:

- **Multiple software learning curves**: Each eye tracker requires learning different annotation software
- **Licensing barriers**: Proprietary tools require licenses and may not be readily available
- **Training overhead**: Domain experts (like surgeons) need training on multiple platforms
- **Fragmented workflows**: Inconsistent annotation formats across different devices

Zarafe solves these problems by providing a unified annotation platform that works with different eye trackers.

## Features

This tool allows users to:
- Load directories containing worldCamera.mp4 recordings and gazeData.tsv files
- View eye tracking videos with gaze position overlays
- Create, mark and manage time-based event annotations
- Save annotations to CSV files for further analysis
- Work with data from any supported eye tracker through a single interface

## Data Preparation

**Important**: Before using Zarafe, you need to convert your eye tracking data:

Zarafe uses [glassesValidator](https://github.com/dcnieho/glassesValidator) to import your eye tracking data. Some eye trackers require preprocessing before importing:

- **Pupil Labs**: Export from Pupil/Neon Player (disable World Video Exporter) or Pupil Cloud
- **Meta Project Aria Gen 1**: Process in Aria Studio with MPS eye gaze run, then use provided export script
- **SMI ETG**: Export raw data and scene video from BeGaze with specific settings

For detailed preprocessing instructions for your specific eye tracker, see the [glassesValidator preprocessing guide](https://github.com/dcnieho/glassesValidator?tab=readme-ov-file#eye-trackers).

The import process will generate the required worldCamera.mp4 and gazeData.tsv files.

Zarafe expects a specific directory structure with each recording in its own folder containing both files.

## Installation

**Requirements**: Python ≥3.9 (tested on Python 3.9-3.12)

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install zarafe
zarafe
```

### Option 2: Install from Source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mh-salari/zarafe.git
   cd zarafe
   ```

2. Install dependencies (choose one method):

   **Option A: Using uv (recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Install uv from https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

   # Install dependencies
   uv sync
   ```

   **Option B: Using pip**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # With uv
   uv run python main.py

   # With pip
   python main.py
   ```
